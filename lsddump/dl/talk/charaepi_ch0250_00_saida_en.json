    "charaepi_ch0250_00_saida/2301_0401_0400_10": "Oh, we just finished battling, actually. I asked\nBrawly to be my opponent.",
    "charaepi_ch0250_00_saida/2301_0302_0500_10": "What’s up?",
    "charaepi_ch0250_00_saida/2301_0402_0600_10": "Brawly agreed to be my opponent, and we had a\ncouple matches. It was a very productive use of\nour time!",
    "charaepi_ch0250_00_saida/2301_1201_0700_10": "Since we both have Fighting-type Pokémon as\nour partners, I was able to learn a lot from\nour battles.",
    "charaepi_ch0250_00_saida/2301_1201_0800_10": "How to perfectly gauge the distance between you\nand your opponent...and how best to brace\nyourself for an attack...",
    "charaepi_ch0250_00_saida/2301_1201_0900_10": "It was very helpful. There are still many strong\nopponents in the world for me to meet.",
    "charaepi_ch0250_00_saida/2301_1201_1000_10": "Today ended for me with one win and one loss.\nUnfortunately, that breaks my winning streak\nof 29 wins...",

    "charaepi_ch0250_00_saida/2301_0401_1200_10": "It’s all thanks to my daily training regimen.",
    "charaepi_ch0250_00_saida/2301_0302_1300_10": "Wow!",
    "charaepi_ch0250_00_saida/2301_0402_1400_10": "It’s all thanks to my daily training regimen.",
    "charaepi_ch0250_00_saida/2301_1201_1500_10": "But I won’t let it give me a big head. I need to be\nhumble and keep getting stronger.",

    "charaepi_ch0250_00_saida/2301_0402_2100_10": "I suppose that’s a good idea. Rushing headlong\ninto training won’t produce good results.",
    "charaepi_ch0250_00_saida/2301_1201_2200_10": "Very well. Let’s take a break, shall we?",
    "charaepi_ch0250_00_saida/2301_1201_2300_10": "Phew... I feel much more relaxed now. Thank you\nvery much for inviting me to join you.",
    "charaepi_ch0250_00_saida/2301_1201_2400_10": "But as effective as that was at relieving\nmy tension...",

    "charaepi_ch0250_00_saida/2301_1201_2900_10": "And just like that, I’m full of energy!",
    "charaepi_ch0250_00_saida/2301_1201_3000_10": "Would you like to give it a go?",
    "charaepi_ch0250_00_saida/2301_0301_3100_10": "Would I!",
    "charaepi_ch0250_00_saida/2301_0401_3200_10": "I should warn you, it can be slightly...somewhat,\num...considerably painful. But it is effective!",
    "charaepi_ch0250_00_saida/2301_0302_3300_10": "That...helps you relax?",
    "charaepi_ch0250_00_saida/2301_0402_3400_10": "Yes! In the sense that I feel re-energized to take\non whatever comes our way!",
    "charaepi_ch0250_00_saida/2301_1201_3500_10": "Hm? Sirfetch’d is telling me to stop?",
