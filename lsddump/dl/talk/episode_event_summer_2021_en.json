    "episode_event_summer_2021/4005_1001_1100_10": "Sorry, Mallow. It’s not that I dislike workin’ here\nat Dine-A-Max or anythin’...",
    "episode_event_summer_2021/4005_1001_1200_10": "It’s just...I wanna compete with Gloria on my\nown terms!",

    "episode_event_summer_2021/4006_1001_0100_10": "I see... So all that happened last night, huh?",
    "episode_event_summer_2021/4006_1001_0200_10": "I get her reason for leaving us, but...",
    "episode_event_summer_2021/4006_1001_0300_10": "I don’t think helping out a rival eatery is the right\nsolution here.",
    "episode_event_summer_2021/4006_1001_0400_10": "If you’re running a business, there’s always\ngoing to be some competition to get customers.",
    "episode_event_summer_2021/4006_1001_0500_10": "But if you stop to help every single store that runs\ninto problems along the way, you might get run\nout of business yourself!",
    "episode_event_summer_2021/4006_1001_0600_10": "And even if that Team Break pop-up gets its\ncustomers back, that’s just temporary. It might not\nlast forever!",
    "episode_event_summer_2021/4006_1001_0700_10": "I know what you mean, Mallow.",
    "episode_event_summer_2021/4006_1001_0800_10": "But I think I understand Marnie’s feelings, too.",
    "episode_event_summer_2021/4006_0301_0900_10": "How so?",
    "episode_event_summer_2021/4006_0401_1000_10": "Because we’re both from Galar...and we’re each\nother’s rival!",
    "episode_event_summer_2021/4006_0302_1100_10": "Yeah! Because you’re rivals!",
    "episode_event_summer_2021/4006_0402_1200_10": "Yup! We’re both from Galar, and we’re each\nother’s rival!",
    "episode_event_summer_2021/4006_1001_1300_10": "That’s why I think I understand where she’s\ncoming from.",
    "episode_event_summer_2021/4006_1001_1400_10": "I know that those Team Break members were\ndoing something wrong.",
    "episode_event_summer_2021/4006_1001_1500_10": "But I think they really were doing their best to\nmake their pop-up succeed!",
    "episode_event_summer_2021/4006_1001_1600_10": "I bet that reminded Marnie of the people back\nin Spikemuth.",
    "episode_event_summer_2021/4006_1001_1700_10": "She loves them a lot, and they’re quite similar to\nTeam Break, if you think about it! So of course\nshe would offer to help them out!",
    "episode_event_summer_2021/4006_1001_1800_10": "I love how kind she is!",
    "episode_event_summer_2021/4006_1001_1900_10": "*sigh* I’d say you’re pretty kind, too, for letting\nher leave us like that.",
    "episode_event_summer_2021/4006_1001_2000_10": "Oh well! Guess we just have to carry on, then!",
    "episode_event_summer_2021/4006_1001_2100_10": "We’ll have to do our very best on our end, too!",
    "episode_event_summer_2021/4006_1001_2200_10": "I’ll see you later. I have to join Marnie now.",
    "episode_event_summer_2021/4006_1001_2300_10": "Oh, hold on a second!",
    "episode_event_summer_2021/4006_1001_2400_10": "Could you pass on a message to Marnie for me?",
    "episode_event_summer_2021/4007_1001_0100_10": "Welcome, welcome! We’ve got some tasty\nZ-Noodles for you to slurp right up!",

    "episode_event_summer_2021/4007_1001_0600_10": "Thanks...",
    "episode_event_summer_2021/4007_1001_0700_10": "*sigh* Why can’t I do it right...",
    "episode_event_summer_2021/4007_1001_0800_10": "I was so confident, and I even declared that we\nwere rivals and left the other pop-up...",
    "episode_event_summer_2021/4007_1001_0900_10": "But I still can’t make a single good smile...",
    "episode_event_summer_2021/4007_1001_1000_10": "No—I have to! Otherwise, I can’t face Gloria!",
    "episode_event_summer_2021/4007_1001_1100_10": "“You can’t force a smile.”",
    "episode_event_summer_2021/4007_1001_1200_10": "“You can find other ways to get more customers.\nWays that are better suited for you!”",
    "episode_event_summer_2021/4007_1001_1300_10": "Gloria told me to tell you that.",
    "episode_event_summer_2021/4007_1001_1400_10": "Gloria? Even though I’m the one who\nchallenged her?",
    "episode_event_summer_2021/4007_1001_1500_10": "I think that’s exactly why she’s telling you this.",
    "episode_event_summer_2021/4007_1001_1600_10": "She also wants to compete with everything she’s\ngot. That’s why she’s giving you this advice.",

    "episode_event_summer_2021/4007_1001_1800_10": "Thanks, Marley. I think Gloria would be\nhappy to hear that, too.",
    "episode_event_summer_2021/4007_1001_1900_10": "I was wondering... Is there anything that makes\nyou smile naturally?",
    "episode_event_summer_2021/4007_1001_2000_10": "Yeah, of course.",
    "episode_event_summer_2021/4007_1001_2100_10": "Oi! Is your Machamp doin’ anythin’ right now?",
    "episode_event_summer_2021/4007_1001_2200_10": "Nope. No customers are here yet, so he’s just\nloafing around. What’re you thinking?",
    "episode_event_summer_2021/4007_1001_2300_10": "Isn’t it obvious? I’ve thought of somethin’ that’s\nsure to bring in loads of customers!",
    "episode_event_summer_2021/4007_1001_2400_10": "What do you mean?",
    "episode_event_summer_2021/4007_1001_2500_10": "Well, obviously I mean that we’re gonna show\neveryone some intense Pokémon battles!",
    "episode_event_summer_2021/4008_1001_0100_10": "[Name:PlayerNickname ]! This batch of Rage\nCandy Bars is ready!",

    "episode_event_summer_2021/4008_1001_0700_10": "What happened to all the people that were here?",
    "episode_event_summer_2021/4008_1001_0800_10": "Gloria, take a look over there!",

    "episode_event_summer_2021/4008_1001_1200_10": "Yeah! We won!",
