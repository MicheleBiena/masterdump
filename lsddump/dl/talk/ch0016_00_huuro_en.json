    "ch0016_00_huuro/0601_0701_01_10": "I asked my Swoobat and Unfezant to take care\nof the Gym while I’m away.",
    "ch0016_00_huuro/0601_0701_02_10": "I hope they’re not getting into any trouble.\nI’m a little worried about them...",
    "ch0016_00_huuro/0601_0701_03_10": "Hmmm, maybe I should head home for a bit\nto check on them.",
    "ch0016_00_huuro/0601_0701_04_10": "Yeah right! There’s still so much I want to do\non Pasio—there’s no way I’m heading home yet!",
    "ch0016_00_huuro/0601_0702_01_10": "It’s not just Pokémon taking care of the Gym.\nThere are a bunch of Trainers there, too.",
    "ch0016_00_huuro/0601_0702_02_10": "They should be fine if I’m away a while longer.",
    "ch0016_00_huuro/0601_0702_03_10": "Ooh, but I should make sure I check in often.\nI don’t want them to miss me too much!",
    "ch0016_00_huuro/0602_0701_01_10": "My Swanna can really move when she battles,\nso I can always count on her.",
    "ch0016_00_huuro/0602_0701_02_10": "She’s normally calm, though, and likes\nto stay neat and looking her best.",
    "ch0016_00_huuro/0602_0701_03_10": "That’s why I always have to keep a brush just\nfor Swanna with me.",
    "ch0016_00_huuro/0602_0702_01_10": "Swanna really loves showing off her bright\nwhite wings!",
    "ch0016_00_huuro/0602_0702_02_10": "It really brought her down when they got dirty\nin battle, so I cleaned her up right away!",
    "ch0016_00_huuro/0603_0701_01_10": "At my Mistralton City Gym, we send Trainers\nflying with cannons and fans.",
    "ch0016_00_huuro/0603_0701_02_10": "Doesn’t that sound like a superfun thrill? \nI thought it was a brilliant idea, \nif I do say so myself.",
    "ch0016_00_huuro/0603_0701_03_10": "But it seems like a lot of Trainers get worn out\nbefore they can get all the way to me.",
    "ch0016_00_huuro/0603_0702_01_10": "You seem tough enough to not be bothered at all\nif you were sent flying.",
    "ch0016_00_huuro/0603_0702_02_10": "If you’re interested, you should come \ntake a shot at my Gym.",
    "ch0016_00_huuro/0604_0701_01_10": "Isn’t my hair tie cute? I love it!",
    "ch0016_00_huuro/0604_0701_02_10": "It’s really well designed, too. It’s easy to gather\nmy hair up and keep it in place.",
    "ch0016_00_huuro/0604_0701_03_10": "Even when the wind is strong, it doesn’t get\nblown away or come loose or anything.",
    "ch0016_00_huuro/0604_0702_01_10": "When you’re flying into the wind, your glasses\nwill fly away in a heartbeat.",
    "ch0016_00_huuro/0604_0702_02_10": "You have to secure all your personal items when\nyou go flying!",
    "ch0016_00_huuro/0605_0701_01_10": "Some places would take forever to walk to.",
    "ch0016_00_huuro/0605_0701_02_10": "But you can fly to them right away in a plane!",
    "ch0016_00_huuro/0605_0701_03_10": "It feels great to fly over mountains and forests.",
    "ch0016_00_huuro/0605_0701_04_10": "[Name:PlayerNickname ], you should come\ntake a trip through the skies with me!",
    "ch0016_00_huuro/0605_0702_01_10": "Flying into the wind or way up above the clouds\nis so much fun.",
    "ch0016_00_huuro/0605_0702_02_10": "And when you’ve got some Pokémon that can fly\nwith you, it’s even more fun!",
    "ch0016_00_huuro/1701_0701_01_10": "Good to see you! I’ve got a present for you.",
    "ch0016_00_huuro/1701_0701_02_10": "I spotted it as I was flying overhead.\nIt’s all yours, so use it however you want!",
    "ch0016_00_huuro/1701_0702_01_10": "Hee-hee! No matter how far away things are,\na pilot’s eyes can see them!",
    "ch0016_00_huuro/1701_0702_02_10": "I’ll probably find something else nice on\nanother flight. I’ll let you know when I do!",
    "ch0016_00_huuro/2501_0701_01_10": "There are so many reasons I like flying,\nit’s hard to explain them all.",
    "ch0016_00_huuro/2501_0701_02_10": "I guess the main thing is that my Pokémon and I\ncan fly anywhere we want.",
    "ch0016_00_huuro/2501_0701_03_10": "There are no walls or ceiling to box us in—the\nfreedom of it feels great.",
    "ch0016_00_huuro/2501_0702_01_10": "There’s more to the sky than just blue and some\nnice white clouds floating by.",
    "ch0016_00_huuro/2501_0702_02_10": "Sometimes it rains, sometimes the winds are\nstrong. Some days, the sky’s just right for flight,\nand some days it’s not.",
    "ch0016_00_huuro/2501_0702_03_10": "It makes you feel like the sky is alive.",
    "ch0016_00_huuro/2511_0701_01_10": "Some things can be tough to do on your own,\nbut if you have help, you can get it done.",
    "ch0016_00_huuro/2511_0701_02_10": "I think that’s really awesome.",
    "ch0016_00_huuro/2511_0701_03_10": "People and Pokémon are all different,\nso when we combine our efforts, our power\nis on a whole different level, too!",
    "ch0016_00_huuro/2511_0701_04_10": "I hope I can battle with even more people\nand Pokémon.",
    "ch0016_00_huuro/2511_0702_01_10": "Maybe the reason Pokémon battles are so fun is\nbecause people and Pokémon get to spend some\nquality time together.",
    "ch0016_00_huuro/2511_0702_02_10": "I mean, you can’t have a Pokémon battle\nall by yourself!",
    "ch0016_00_huuro/2511_0702_03_10": "That’s why I always try to enjoy myself when I’m\nhaving a Pokémon battle.",
    "ch0016_00_huuro/3001_0701_01_10": "Good morning! Hee hee!\nPilots are good at waking up early, you know!",
    "ch0016_00_huuro/3002_0701_01_10": "Morning! I hope today’s full of fun!",
    "ch0016_00_huuro/3003_0701_01_10": "Hi there! \nThe weather’s perfect for a flight today.\nWhat do you say?",
    "ch0016_00_huuro/3004_0701_01_10": "Hiya! Isn’t the weather nice today? \nMaybe I should go clean my plane.",
    "ch0016_00_huuro/3005_0701_01_10": "Evening! You’re working pretty late, huh?\nAre you staying up for something exciting?",
    "ch0016_00_huuro/3006_0701_01_10": "Playing outside at night always gives me\nsuch a thrill! You have to be careful, though.\nIt’s kinda hard to see.",
