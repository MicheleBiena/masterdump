    "ch0022_00_urup/0601_0701_01_10": "You’re wondering whether I get cold dressed\nlike this all year?",
    "ch0022_00_urup/0601_0701_02_10": "I’m sure there are people around you that spend\nthe year in short sleeves, y’know?",
    "ch0022_00_urup/0601_0701_03_10": "Those people have blazing spirits! That’s why\nthe cold doesn’t bother them.",
    "ch0022_00_urup/0601_0702_01_10": "I mean, I get cold, too, y’know?",
    "ch0022_00_urup/0601_0702_02_10": "If you’re not 100 percent on your game all the\ntime, you have to find a way to keep warm.",
    "ch0022_00_urup/0602_0701_01_10": "Ice is a bit of a paradox, y’know?\nIt’s both durable and fragile.",
    "ch0022_00_urup/0602_0701_02_10": "Fragile when warm and durable when cold.",
    "ch0022_00_urup/0602_0701_03_10": "Power is just as fickle. \nBut that is what makes it fun.",

    "ch0022_00_urup/0603_0701_02_10": "In any case, you can say the one who enjoys\nthemselves the most is the winner, y’know?",
    "ch0022_00_urup/0603_0701_03_10": "Time is limited. We don’t have the kind of time\nto think about things like winning or losing.",
    "ch0022_00_urup/0603_0702_01_10": "I’m impressed with how you \ninteract with your Pokémon.",
    "ch0022_00_urup/0603_0702_02_10": "There are Trainers that want to become stronger\nor maybe become closer to their Pokémon.",
    "ch0022_00_urup/0603_0702_03_10": "Just like how no two people have \nthe same thoughts, the same can be said \nfor Pokémon as well.",
    "ch0022_00_urup/0603_0702_04_10": "So being able to have fun alongside your\nPokémon is an incredibly precious thing.",

    "ch0022_00_urup/0604_0701_03_10": "All I could say was, “Oh yeah, that’s a few days\naway, isn’t it?” She got mad at me...",
    "ch0022_00_urup/0604_0701_04_10": "I mean, what is “it” anyway, y’know?",
    "ch0022_00_urup/0604_0701_05_10": "It must’ve been our anniversary! Yeesh! \nWe all have something we’re not good at.",
    "ch0022_00_urup/0604_0702_01_10": "I can be tough as an iceberg, hot as a furnace,\nbut there’s one thing that I cannot stand up to.",

    "ch0022_00_urup/0605_0702_02_10": "If you ever find a hurt Pokémon, I hope you care\nfor it. You have a good heart. I’m sure you will.",
    "ch0022_00_urup/1701_0701_01_10": "I found this caught in one of Avalugg’s cracks.",
    "ch0022_00_urup/1701_0701_02_10": "Here, you can have it. Use it well.",
    "ch0022_00_urup/1701_0702_01_10": "Avalugg has really big cracks, so if you don’t\nclean them often, you’ll find a bunch of things \ncaught in there!",
    "ch0022_00_urup/1701_0702_02_10": "I once lost a present I meant to give to my kids,\nbut I found it in one of Avalugg’s cracks!\nHa ha! *sigh*",
    "ch0022_00_urup/2501_0701_01_10": "I might be a Gym Leader, but I can only be one\nthanks to the support I get from my family.",

    "ch0022_00_urup/2501_0702_03_10": "Besides, y’know... It’s nice to think \nthat your family is always with you.",
    "ch0022_00_urup/2511_0701_01_10": "Spending time with you warms my heart.",
    "ch0022_00_urup/2511_0701_02_10": "Both people and Pokémon alike have hearts.\nI’m just saying that you have a warmth that\nis soothing to those around you.",
    "ch0022_00_urup/2511_0701_03_10": "At the very least, Avalugg here and I like you!",
    "ch0022_00_urup/2511_0701_04_10": "I bet the people and Pokémon that approach\nyou can see that you have a kind heart, too.",
