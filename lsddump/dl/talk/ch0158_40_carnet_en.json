    "ch0158_40_carnet/0101_0701_02_10": "Hehe! I’m just practicing for a role! Let’s have a\ngreat day again today, shall we?",
    "ch0158_40_carnet/7101_0701_01_10": "I once played the part of a knight back in Kalos\nand used several different Pokémon as a\nreference for the role.",
    "ch0158_40_carnet/7101_0701_02_10": "For example, Gallade, Aegislash, and Escavalier,\njust to name a few.",
    "ch0158_40_carnet/7101_0701_03_10": "It was a great experience for me, and it even\nhelped increase my Pokémon knowledge.",
    "ch0158_40_carnet/7102_0701_01_10": "Did you know? Legend has it that Keldeo has three\nPokémon mentors that trained it.",
    "ch0158_40_carnet/7102_0701_02_10": "I sure would love to see how Pokémon teach each\nother to battle.",
    "ch0158_40_carnet/7103_0701_01_10": "This outfit looks heavy, you say?",
    "ch0158_40_carnet/7103_0701_02_10": "Hehehe. I may not look it, but I’m actually quite\nstrong, you know!",
    "ch0158_40_carnet/7103_0701_03_10": "Looks alone aren’t enough to make me a good\nactress. I have to be physically fit as well!",
    "ch0158_40_carnet/7104_0701_01_10": "Keldeo loves beautiful areas near water.",
    "ch0158_40_carnet/7104_0701_02_10": "Here on Pasio, it really likes playing near the\nfountain in town. It’s a beautiful area with a great\natmosphere, after all.",
    "ch0158_40_carnet/7105_0701_01_10": "Do you have anything that you want to\nprotect, [Name:PlayerNickname ]?",
    "ch0158_40_carnet/7105_0701_02_10": "Those with something to protect must train hard to\nprepare themselves for when that time comes.",
    "ch0158_40_carnet/7105_0701_03_10": "And not just physical strength but mental strength\nas well. It’s hard to fight without a solid mind to\nback up your body.",
    "ch0158_40_carnet/1701_0701_01_10": "I bequeath this gift unto you.",
    "ch0158_40_carnet/1701_0701_02_10": "May it protect you in my stead—even when I am\nfar away.",
    "ch0158_40_carnet/1701_0702_01_10": "Thank you for helping me practice my\nacting earlier!",
    "ch0158_40_carnet/1701_0702_02_10": "As a thank-you, you can keep the item I gave you\nduring practice as a gift. I hope you can put it to\ngood use!",
    "ch0158_40_carnet/2501_0701_01_10": "When Keldeo and Gardevoir first met, they both\nfroze in place as if cautiously observing\neach other.",
    "ch0158_40_carnet/2501_0701_02_10": "It seems like they’ve learned to relax a bit now\nthat they’ve been together for a while, but...",
    "ch0158_40_carnet/2501_0701_03_10": "They were both studying each other so intently at\nthe time. I wonder what they were thinking.",
    "ch0158_40_carnet/2501_0702_01_10": "They’re both a bit finicky at times, but these days\nI even catch them taking naps together sometimes.",
    "ch0158_40_carnet/2501_0702_02_10": "I can’t help but smile when I see them so\nrelaxed together.",
    "ch0158_40_carnet/2511_0701_01_10": "My Keldeo has a noble heart and is very strict\nwith itself.",
    "ch0158_40_carnet/2511_0701_02_10": "Keldeo is currently serving as my inspiration when\nI rehearse and battle. It’s a great way for me to\nget fired up!",
    "ch0158_40_carnet/2511_0702_01_10": "I often hear that Pokémon tend to take on a bit of\ntheir Trainer’s personality...",
    "ch0158_40_carnet/2511_0702_02_10": "but I suppose the opposite is possible, too, right?",
    "ch0158_40_carnet/3001_0701_01_10": "And so the young Trainers set off on their journey\nwith the sunrise behind them...and a grand\nadventure ahead! *giggle*",
    "ch0158_40_carnet/3003_0701_01_10": "With all of the training and acting I do, I have to\nbe careful not to overbook my schedule. Getting in\na good lunch break is key!",
    "ch0158_40_carnet/3005_0701_01_10": "The wind can get pretty chilly at night. If you’re\ngoing out, make sure you dress warmly! Wouldn’t\nwant you to catch a cold!",
