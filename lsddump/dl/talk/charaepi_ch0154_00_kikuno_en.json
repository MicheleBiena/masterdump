    "charaepi_ch0154_00_kikuno/2301_1201_1300_10": "Oh, this Hippowdon. She’s just brimming with\ncuriosity, and she’s quite a handful. I can’t take\nmy eyes off her for a second. ",
    "charaepi_ch0154_00_kikuno/2301_1201_1400_10": "Oh, stop! This isn’t a game of tag, you know!",

    "charaepi_ch0154_00_kikuno/2301_1201_2400_10": "I’m very happy to hear that we look like a family!",

    "charaepi_ch0154_00_kikuno/2301_1201_2600_10": "Actually, this Hippowdon used to be too wild and\nrough. She lived alone, not part of any herd.",
    "charaepi_ch0154_00_kikuno/2301_1201_2700_10": "Perhaps she thought that because she was stronger\nthan all the others, she could live just fine on\nher own.",
    "charaepi_ch0154_00_kikuno/2301_0301_2800_10": "Do you think she was lonely?",
    "charaepi_ch0154_00_kikuno/2301_0401_2900_10": "Her mind is as strong as her body, so it probably\ndidn’t occur to her to feel lonely. Still, it seemed\nlike such a waste.",
    "charaepi_ch0154_00_kikuno/2301_0302_3000_10": "That sounds tough.",
    "charaepi_ch0154_00_kikuno/2301_0402_3100_10": "Yes, living all alone can be a sad, difficult thing.",
    "charaepi_ch0154_00_kikuno/2301_1201_3200_10": "As soon as I encountered this girl, I realized she\ncould have become so much stronger if she had\nplayed and practiced with her herd.",
    "charaepi_ch0154_00_kikuno/2301_1201_3300_10": "She kept threatening me with her huge mouth,\ntrying to scare me away, but...I wanted to show\nher that she’s not alone.",
    "charaepi_ch0154_00_kikuno/2301_1201_3400_10": "And little by little, we grew closer.",
    "charaepi_ch0154_00_kikuno/2301_0301_3500_10": "Weren’t you scared?",
    "charaepi_ch0154_00_kikuno/2301_0401_3600_10": "No, I was never scared.",
    "charaepi_ch0154_00_kikuno/2301_0401_3700_10": "I believed in this Hippowdon—that while she may\ntry to startle people, she’d never hurt anyone.",
    "charaepi_ch0154_00_kikuno/2301_0302_3800_10": "So you never gave up.",
    "charaepi_ch0154_00_kikuno/2301_0402_3900_10": "I realized that deep down, she really was lonely,\nso I couldn’t just leave her on her own.",
    "charaepi_ch0154_00_kikuno/2301_1201_4000_10": "The more you put your trust in someone, the more\nthey can trust you as well.",
    "charaepi_ch0154_00_kikuno/2301_1201_4100_10": "I made up my mind to keep believing in\nHippowdon until she believed in me, too.",
    "charaepi_ch0154_00_kikuno/2301_1201_4200_10": "Now the only time she bares her teeth at me is\nwhen I’m brushing them.",
    "charaepi_ch0154_00_kikuno/2301_1201_4300_10": "Ahaha! We really do have a bond like a parent\nand child!",
    "charaepi_ch0154_00_kikuno/2301_1201_4400_10": "And I think that’s a wonderful thing!",
