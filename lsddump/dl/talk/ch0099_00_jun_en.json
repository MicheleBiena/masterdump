    "ch0099_00_jun/0101_0701_02_10": "You want to have a Pokémon battle, too, right?\nI’m fining you a million if you’re late!",
    "ch0099_00_jun/0601_0701_01_10": "My dad is Palmer, the Battle Frontier’s\nTower Tycoon! He’s so awesomely cool!",
    "ch0099_00_jun/0601_0701_02_10": "I want to be a cool, tough Trainer like my dad.",
    "ch0099_00_jun/0601_0701_03_10": "Then I’ll be able to have Pokémon battles with\nlots of other tough Trainers!",
    "ch0099_00_jun/0601_0701_04_10": "That’s why there’s no time to lose!\nI’ve gotta get to work!",
    "ch0099_00_jun/0601_0702_01_10": "You’ll see! I’m gonna be a cool Trainer just like\nmy dad!",
    "ch0099_00_jun/0601_0702_02_10": "That’s why I’m making sure not to slack off on\nmy training or whatever.",
    "ch0099_00_jun/0602_0701_01_10": "Piplup really has a lot of pride.",
    "ch0099_00_jun/0602_0701_02_10": "When I was just starting out as a Trainer,\nhe didn’t listen to me at all!",
    "ch0099_00_jun/0602_0701_03_10": "But now my relationship with Piplup is\ntotally different!",
    "ch0099_00_jun/0602_0701_04_10": "Piplup is my reliable ace in the hole now!\nMakes me wanna puff out my chest with pride!",
    "ch0099_00_jun/0602_0702_01_10": "When Piplup started listening to what I said...",
    "ch0099_00_jun/0602_0702_02_10": "I was so happy that he had finally\naccepted me as a Trainer!",
    "ch0099_00_jun/0602_0702_03_10": "That’s why I decided to get even\ntougher—for Piplup!",
    "ch0099_00_jun/0603_0701_01_10": "Hey, I’ve been on an adventure with Staraptor!",
    "ch0099_00_jun/0603_0701_02_10": "When I got on his back, he took off and\nstarted flying around super fast!\nI was holding on for dear life!",
    "ch0099_00_jun/0603_0701_03_10": "But the scenery you can see when you’re flying\nthrough the air is incredibly beautiful!",
    "ch0099_00_jun/0603_0701_04_10": "Don’t you wanna try to ride him once?\nIf you get scared and cry, I’ll fine you!",
    "ch0099_00_jun/0603_0702_01_10": "Staraptor is so cool! You can fly anywhere with\nhim straightaway thanks to his Fly move!",
    "ch0099_00_jun/0603_0702_02_10": "But I’m trying to walk more and not fly\neverywhere. Physical health is the\nfoundation of any tough Trainer!",
    "ch0099_00_jun/0603_0702_03_10": "Don’t get the wrong idea!\nIt’s not because I’m scared or anything!",
    "ch0099_00_jun/0604_0701_01_10": "I smack right into people a lot when I run.\nLike...thud!",
    "ch0099_00_jun/0604_0701_02_10": "So I’m trying to think up a way of running\nwhere I won’t bump into people so much,\nbut it’s pretty hard!",
    "ch0099_00_jun/0604_0701_03_10": "I mean, I guess I could just walk,\nbut it’s so slow!",
    "ch0099_00_jun/0604_0701_04_10": "I run because I wanna hurry up and get to\nwhere I’m going!",
    "ch0099_00_jun/0604_0702_01_10": "I wanna get tougher and tougher.\nThere are still so many things I wanna do!",
    "ch0099_00_jun/0604_0702_02_10": "That’s why I’ve got no time to sit around\ntaking it easy!",
    "ch0099_00_jun/0604_0702_03_10": "But between you and me, sometimes going\naround the long way can turn out to be\na shortcut.",
    "ch0099_00_jun/0605_0701_01_10": "Hey, [Name:PlayerNickname ], is there\nanyone you look up to?",
    "ch0099_00_jun/0605_0701_02_10": "Of course I have someone I look up to—my dad,\nthe Frontier Brain Tower Tycoon!",
    "ch0099_00_jun/0605_0701_03_10": "The Tower Tycoon is the toughest Trainer at a\nfacility called the Battle Tower, you know.",
    "ch0099_00_jun/0605_0701_04_10": "If you don’t win a ton of Pokémon battles,\nyou can’t even battle him!",
    "ch0099_00_jun/0605_0701_05_10": "I want to be cool like my dad! That’s the reason\nI decided to become a Trainer!",
    "ch0099_00_jun/0605_0702_01_10": "Of course I want to beat my dad in a\nPokémon battle.",
    "ch0099_00_jun/0605_0702_02_10": "Winning alone won’t make me into a cool\nTrainer like my dad, though.",
    "ch0099_00_jun/0605_0702_03_10": "Hmm, what should I do? I guess I’ve still got a\nlong way to go, huh?",
    "ch0099_00_jun/0605_0702_04_10": "I will do it, though!\nTry to keep up, [Name:PlayerNickname ]!",
    "ch0099_00_jun/1701_0701_01_10": "Hey, you can have this!",
    "ch0099_00_jun/1701_0701_02_10": "I’ve already got one. One what?\nThis item, of course!",
    "ch0099_00_jun/1701_0702_01_10": "I could learn a lot from the way you use items.",
    "ch0099_00_jun/1701_0702_02_10": "So if I find another good item, I’ll give it to you!",
    "ch0099_00_jun/2501_0701_01_10": "I’ve got a friend from Twinleaf Town just like me\nwho’s amazingly tough in Pokémon battles!",
    "ch0099_00_jun/2501_0701_02_10": "Battling with you makes me think of that kid.",
    "ch0099_00_jun/2501_0701_03_10": "It makes me wanna win even more!",
    "ch0099_00_jun/2501_0701_04_10": "Let’s go together someday. Then we can have a\nbattle with my old friend!",
    "ch0099_00_jun/2501_0702_01_10": "When you’ve got a really tough Trainer by\nyour side, it gives you confidence!",
    "ch0099_00_jun/2501_0702_02_10": "You can’t have a Pokémon battle by yourself,\nso there’s no point in getting tougher if you’re\nall alone.",
    "ch0099_00_jun/2501_0702_03_10": "When you have an opponent who wants to get\ntougher and battle against you, it makes you so\namazingly happy!",
    "ch0099_00_jun/2511_0701_01_10": "Pokémon battles are hard. When you get your\ndirections wrong, you can lose just like that!",
    "ch0099_00_jun/2511_0701_02_10": "When Pokémon are tough, you can be sure they\nhave a Trainer they can count on.",
    "ch0099_00_jun/2511_0701_03_10": "I’m doing my best to keep my precious Pokémon\nfrom getting hurt in battle.",
    "ch0099_00_jun/2511_0701_04_10": "I think it’s because I’ve been trying so hard that\nmy Pokémon grew to like me.",
    "ch0099_00_jun/2511_0702_01_10": "There are some things Pokémon can’t do\nand some things Trainers can’t do.",
    "ch0099_00_jun/2511_0702_02_10": "If each of them focuses on getting better at the\nthings they can do, they make the toughest team!",
    "ch0099_00_jun/3001_0701_01_10": "Morning! You slept in, huh?\nI’ve been awake since yesterday!",
    "ch0099_00_jun/3002_0701_01_10": "I try to take after my master and wake up early!\nCome to think of it, though,\nI’m not even sure if he does wake up early...",
    "ch0099_00_jun/3003_0701_01_10": "*yawn* Starting to feel a little sleepy.\nBut I gotta keep going full steam ahead!",
    "ch0099_00_jun/3004_0701_01_10": "I’m definitely prepared for some battling today!\nThere’s no way I’ll forget anything this time.",
    "ch0099_00_jun/3005_0701_01_10": "Evening!\nYou’d think I’d be tired now, but I’m still wired!",
    "ch0099_00_jun/3006_0701_01_10": "Time for my secret night training! \nWait, if you’ve found me, \nit’s not secret anymore!",
