    "ch0045_00_tsukushi/0101_0701_02_10": "I wanted to show you the results of\nall the new research I’ve been doing!",
    "ch0045_00_tsukushi/0601_0701_01_10": "A lot of people think Bug-type Pokémon,\nlike Weedle and Kakuna, are creepy.",
    "ch0045_00_tsukushi/0601_0701_02_10": "They don’t understand how awesome\nand cute Bug-type Pokémon really are!",
    "ch0045_00_tsukushi/0601_0701_03_10": "When they evolve, sometimes they look\ncompletely different than they did before!\nIt never gets old!",
    "ch0045_00_tsukushi/0601_0702_01_10": "They can go from a superhardened\nchrysalis to sprouting big,\nbeautiful wings!",
    "ch0045_00_tsukushi/0601_0702_02_10": "Don’t you find that super mysterious?!\nOh boy, I’d love to expand my circle\nof Bug-type Pokémon enthusiasts!",
    "ch0045_00_tsukushi/0602_0701_01_10": "When I go to the library, I can never\nreach the books on the upper shelves,\nno matter how far I stretch.",
    "ch0045_00_tsukushi/0602_0701_02_10": "I wish I could use String Shot!\nI could grab a book from up high\nand pull it right into my hand!",
    "ch0045_00_tsukushi/0602_0701_03_10": "You know what would be even cooler?\nIf I had beautiful wings to fly with,\nlike my Bug-type Pokémon...",
    "ch0045_00_tsukushi/0602_0701_04_10": "I wish I could evolve, like\nMetapod or Kakuna.",
    "ch0045_00_tsukushi/0602_0702_01_10": "Maybe, when I grow up, I’ll completely\nchange my shape, too—just like\na chrysalis!",
    "ch0045_00_tsukushi/0602_0702_02_10": "I wish, I wish!",
    "ch0045_00_tsukushi/0603_0701_01_10": "When I grow up, I wanna be just like\nthe world-famous Pokémon professor,\nProfessor Oak!",
    "ch0045_00_tsukushi/0603_0701_02_10": "I wanna be super knowledgeable about ALL\nPokémon, not just Bug-type Pokémon!",
    "ch0045_00_tsukushi/0603_0701_03_10": "Oh boy! If I could do research alongside\nProfessor Oak someday, that would be a\ndream come true.",
    "ch0045_00_tsukushi/0603_0701_04_10": "That’s why I’ve gotta study,\nstudy, study so I can make\nthat happen one day!",
    "ch0045_00_tsukushi/0603_0702_01_10": "I’ll be rooting for your dreams to\ncome true, too!\nLet’s work hard together!",
    "ch0045_00_tsukushi/0603_0702_02_10": "It’s better to have a goal in sight\nthan to run around recklessly.\nAt least, that’s what I think.",
    "ch0045_00_tsukushi/0604_0701_01_10": "When I was back in Johto, one of the\nPokémon I focused my research on\nthe most was Scyther.",
    "ch0045_00_tsukushi/0604_0701_02_10": "They zip around reeeally fast,\nso it was extremely hard to catch one.",
    "ch0045_00_tsukushi/0604_0701_03_10": "Then again, the challenge made me\nthat much happier when I did manage\nto finally catch one!",
    "ch0045_00_tsukushi/0604_0702_01_10": "Most people tend to focus on its\nrazor-sharp scythes...",
    "ch0045_00_tsukushi/0604_0702_02_10": "but the way Scyther’s beautiful green\ncolor blends into the grass and trees\nis also pretty amazing, if you ask me.",
    "ch0045_00_tsukushi/0605_0701_01_10": "Do you think there’s a Legendary Pokémon\nout there that’s a Bug type?",
    "ch0045_00_tsukushi/0605_0701_02_10": "If you ever hear any rumors about one,\npromise you’ll tell me!",
    "ch0045_00_tsukushi/0605_0701_03_10": "I’d search high and low all over the\nworld if it meant I could meet a\nLegendary Bug-type Pokémon.",
    "ch0045_00_tsukushi/0605_0701_04_10": "A-and if I did, I’d be the most\nexcited bug catcher in the whole\nwide world!",
    "ch0045_00_tsukushi/0605_0702_01_10": "If you’re searching for a Pokémon,\nyou should never give up! One will\nappear eventually—if you keep at it!",
    "ch0045_00_tsukushi/0605_0702_02_10": "That’s pretty much the\nstory of my life!",
    "ch0045_00_tsukushi/1701_0701_01_10": "I found something neat when I was\nout catching some bugs.\nHere, you can have it!",
    "ch0045_00_tsukushi/1701_0701_02_10": "Don’t worry about it! It’s just a little\ntoken of thanks for all the things you\ndo for me.",
    "ch0045_00_tsukushi/1701_0702_01_10": "Sometimes I catch more than just\nBug-type Pokémon in my net...",
    "ch0045_00_tsukushi/1701_0702_02_10": "like handy items and stuff!\nI’ll be sure to share what I\nfind with you!",
    "ch0045_00_tsukushi/2501_0701_01_10": "If someone were to ask me why I love\nBug-type Pokémon so much...I...I’m not\nsure how I’d answer that.",
    "ch0045_00_tsukushi/2501_0701_02_10": "They’re beautiful, they’re cool,\nthey’re tough! And, and...",
    "ch0045_00_tsukushi/2501_0701_03_10": "and there are so many amazing things\nabout them that I don’t think I could\nlist them all if I tried!",
    "ch0045_00_tsukushi/2501_0702_01_10": "Sometimes, it’s hard to explain\nwhy you love something.",
    "ch0045_00_tsukushi/2501_0702_02_10": "That’s why I want to show everyone,\nnot just tell them, how awesome my\nBeedrill is! I want them all to see it!",
    "ch0045_00_tsukushi/2501_0702_03_10": "When you see Beedrill’s giant stingers\nand sharp, powerful attacks, it’ll be\nlove at first sight!",
    "ch0045_00_tsukushi/2511_0701_01_10": "Whenever we have a conversation, I feel\nlike I just babble nonstop about\nBug-type Pokémon and nothing else.",
    "ch0045_00_tsukushi/2511_0701_02_10": "Are you good at listening?\nYou’re so easy to talk to.",
    "ch0045_00_tsukushi/2511_0701_03_10": "I hope we can keep talking to each\nother like this—as friends! That would\nmake me really happy!",
    "ch0045_00_tsukushi/2511_0702_01_10": "I really like you and I really like\nBug-type Pokémon, so I always want to\ntell you all about them!",
    "ch0045_00_tsukushi/2511_0702_02_10": "If you have anything that you\nreally like, you can tell me all\nabout it, too!",
    "ch0045_00_tsukushi/3001_0701_01_10": "Up and at ’em! Those Bug-type Pokémon\naren’t gonna research themselves!",
    "ch0045_00_tsukushi/3002_0701_01_10": "Good morning. It’s so early. How do you have\nso much energy? I’m still sleepy.",
    "ch0045_00_tsukushi/3003_0701_01_10": "Hey! Do you want to take a little nap\nbefore heading out?",
    "ch0045_00_tsukushi/3004_0701_01_10": "Good afternoon! The weather is so nice.\nWe should go do some nature observation!",
    "ch0045_00_tsukushi/3005_0701_01_10": "Gee, look at the time!\nSometimes I get so caught up in my research,\nI don’t realize how late it’s getting.",
    "ch0045_00_tsukushi/3006_0701_01_10": "Wow, you’re out late tonight! Maybe I should put\nin a few extra hours of research myself!",
