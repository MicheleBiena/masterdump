    "episode_event_mypace2022/4001_1001_0700_10": "Here’s how it’ll work: I’ll take the three of you to\na certain location.",

    "episode_event_mypace2022/4003_1001_0400_10": "Huh?",
    "episode_event_mypace2022/4003_1001_0500_10": "Instead of trying to be like someone else, you\nshould try to be someone only YOU can be.",

    "episode_event_mypace2022/4003_1001_0700_10": "That’s right. It’s important to learn the differences\nbetween yourself and others...",
