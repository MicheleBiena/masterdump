    "episode_event_specialcos01_ch0158_40_carnet/4002_1201_1000_10": "I suppose that makes sense. Battling as Champion\ncan sometimes stifle the flair of things, as there’s a\ncertain way we’re expected to act.",
    "episode_event_specialcos01_ch0158_40_carnet/4002_1201_1100_10": "Ah, I think I understand what you mean! Wearing\ndifferent hats can be tough, yeah!",

    "episode_event_specialcos01_ch0158_40_carnet/4002_1201_1500_10": "Are you gonna be acting as a knight until the\nevent starts?",
    "episode_event_specialcos01_ch0158_40_carnet/4002_1201_1600_10": "*chuckle* That would be a bit much, even for me!",
    "episode_event_specialcos01_ch0158_40_carnet/4002_1201_1700_10": "I’ll make sure that Diantha the Knight shows up\nagain at just the right moment!",
    "episode_event_specialcos01_ch0158_40_carnet/4002_1201_1900_10": "That seems like an excellent plan.",
    "episode_event_specialcos01_ch0158_40_carnet/4002_1201_2000_10": "That way, on the day of the event, I can show\neveryone the finest acting and battling I have\nto offer!",
