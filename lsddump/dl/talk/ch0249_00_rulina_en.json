    "ch0249_00_rulina/0101_0701_02_10": "I’ll keep on swimming so I don’t get washed away\nby your momentum!",
    "ch0249_00_rulina/7101_0701_01_10": "Do you like to fish?",
    "ch0249_00_rulina/7101_0701_02_10": "When I’m fishing, I get excited wondering what\nsort of Pokémon will take the bait and how the\nencounter might unfold.",
    "ch0249_00_rulina/7101_0701_03_10": "There’s a tension to it that I find charming. It’s not\nunlike taking on the Gym Challenge!",
    "ch0249_00_rulina/7102_0701_01_10": "I met Sonia when I did my Gym Challenge, and\nwe’re still good friends to this day.",
    "ch0249_00_rulina/7102_0701_02_10": "Though we’ve chosen different paths in life, she\nstill understands me and what I go through.",
    "ch0249_00_rulina/7102_0701_03_10": "She’s saved me so many times. I just love her\npositive personality!",
    "ch0249_00_rulina/7103_0701_01_10": "I hear that many strong sync pairs have gathered\nhere on Pasio.",
    "ch0249_00_rulina/7103_0701_02_10": "I’m going to train by challenging the Grass-type\nsync pairs first!",
    "ch0249_00_rulina/7103_0701_03_10": "Then, once I’ve gotten stronger, I’m going to\nask Milo for a rematch—and this time, I’ll be\nthe victor!",
    "ch0249_00_rulina/7104_0701_01_10": "I think it’s normal to feel frustrated when\nyou lose.",
    "ch0249_00_rulina/7104_0701_02_10": "But I don’t stop there—I also try to analyze what\nwent wrong!",
    "ch0249_00_rulina/7104_0701_03_10": "If you stop thinking, you limit how much you\ncan grow.",
    "ch0249_00_rulina/7105_0701_01_10": "A model, by definition, is one who serves as an\nexample to others.",
    "ch0249_00_rulina/7105_0701_02_10": "That means at any given moment, wherever they\nhappen to be, others are watching them.",
    "ch0249_00_rulina/7105_0701_03_10": "By that standard, I would also consider you a\nmodel, [Name:PlayerNickname ].",
    "ch0249_00_rulina/7105_0701_04_10": "The way you care for your Pokémon makes you\na wonderful role model for other Trainers.",
    "ch0249_00_rulina/1701_0701_01_10": "Oh, there you are!",
    "ch0249_00_rulina/1701_0701_02_10": "I’ve got something for you. You can have it, if\nyou like!",
    "ch0249_00_rulina/1701_0702_01_10": "With that refined mind of yours, I’m sure you’ll\nmake good use of that.",
    "ch0249_00_rulina/2501_0701_01_10": "When I let go and allow the waves to carry me,\nI feel like I’m the only one in the world.",
    "ch0249_00_rulina/2501_0701_02_10": "That’s what I do to relax whenever I’m feeling\ndown or tired.",
    "ch0249_00_rulina/2501_0701_03_10": "Try to keep that a secret from everyone\nelse, though.",
    "ch0249_00_rulina/2501_0702_01_10": "I let the waves wash away all my bad feelings.",
    "ch0249_00_rulina/2501_0702_02_10": "That’s why I can fight the good fight again today,\nboth in Pokémon battles and in modeling!",
    "ch0249_00_rulina/2511_0701_01_10": "I won’t cut corners as a Gym Leader or a model.",
    "ch0249_00_rulina/2511_0701_02_10": "Doing so would only let down everyone who looks\nup to me.",
    "ch0249_00_rulina/2511_0701_03_10": "And I would be letting myself down, too.",
    "ch0249_00_rulina/2511_0701_04_10": "That’s why I’m always aiming to be number one,\nwith all I’ve got!",
    "ch0249_00_rulina/2511_0702_01_10": "Putting one hundred percent of your energy into\nsomething can be rather taxing.",
    "ch0249_00_rulina/2511_0702_02_10": "But that effort is what allows you to go one step\nbeyond everyone else.",
    "ch0249_00_rulina/2511_0702_03_10": "And why wouldn’t you want to stand out from\nthe crowd?",
    "ch0249_00_rulina/3001_0701_01_10": "Oh hey! My partner and I just got back from our\nmorning swim. A quick splash in the ocean always\nwakes us right up!",
    "ch0249_00_rulina/3003_0701_01_10": "Pasio’s brilliant, isn’t it! The fact that there are\nother Trainers here who model and act gives me\nsuch good motivation!",
    "ch0249_00_rulina/3005_0701_01_10": "Hey, how’s your day going? My partner and I are\nready for a deep massage after all the swimming\nwe did today!",
