    "ch0110_01_kasumi/0101_0701_02_10": "Come on—let’s give it all we’ve got!\nAnd don’t be afraid to ask questions, OK?\nYou can ask me anything!",
    "ch0110_01_kasumi/0601_0701_01_10": "So, what’s your policy when it comes to\ntraining up your Pokémon?",
    "ch0110_01_kasumi/0601_0701_02_10": "I mean, what do you think about when\nchoosing a Pokémon to be your partner\nin a sync pair?",
    "ch0110_01_kasumi/0601_0701_03_10": "When you’re aiming to master something,\nI feel like sticking to a policy is super important.",
    "ch0110_01_kasumi/0601_0702_01_10": "You and your Pokémon always look like\nyou’re having so much fun while you battle.",
    "ch0110_01_kasumi/0601_0702_02_10": "Whatever your personal policy is when it\ncomes to training, I’m sure it must be as\nall-out powerful as mine!",
    "ch0110_01_kasumi/0601_0702_03_10": "That’s really amazing, you know!",
    "ch0110_01_kasumi/0602_0701_01_10": "I’m so excited for the Pokémon Masters League!\nOnly the toughest Trainers get to compete.",
    "ch0110_01_kasumi/0602_0701_02_10": "If I get the chance to battle it out, I’d love to\ngo up against a certain Ice-type Trainer...",
    "ch0110_01_kasumi/0602_0701_03_10": "Lorelei, from the Indigo League Elite Four\nin Kanto! I’ll show her what an all-out\noffensive looks like!",
    "ch0110_01_kasumi/0602_0702_01_10": "I’ve always looked up to Lorelei’s calm, cool,\nintellectual battle style.",
    "ch0110_01_kasumi/0602_0702_02_10": "I’ve already battled against so many different\nTrainers since coming to Pasio.",
    "ch0110_01_kasumi/0602_0702_03_10": "I feel like I’m bound to face her eventually!",
    "ch0110_01_kasumi/0603_0701_01_10": "Water-type Pokémon are all so adorable,\ndon’t you think?",
    "ch0110_01_kasumi/0603_0701_02_10": "Starmie, Psyduck, Dewgong, Quagsire, Seaking,\nLanturn, Slowbro...",

    "ch0110_01_kasumi/0603_0701_04_10": "I love every last one of them! But it’s Starmie here\nthat I chose to partner up with as a sync pair.",
    "ch0110_01_kasumi/0603_0702_01_10": "Do you like Water-type Pokémon, too?",
    "ch0110_01_kasumi/0603_0702_02_10": "Starmie is so nice. It always helps me out\nwith morning training.",
    "ch0110_01_kasumi/0603_0702_03_10": "And there’s nothing like surfing the waves\non a Lapras! Let me know if you ever\nfeel like giving it a shot!",
    "ch0110_01_kasumi/0604_0701_01_10": "That red crystal in the center of Starmie’s body\nis what we call its “core.” It kinda looks like\na jewel, right?",
    "ch0110_01_kasumi/0604_0701_02_10": "Well, it may be pretty, but Starmie’s not just \nfor looks! Starmie is actually super fast.",
    "ch0110_01_kasumi/0604_0701_03_10": "It’s also great at supporting its allies—\nStarmie’s just a really dependable Pokémon\nall around!",
    "ch0110_01_kasumi/0604_0702_01_10": "Did you know that Bubble Beam is one of\nStarmie’s specialties?",
    "ch0110_01_kasumi/0604_0702_02_10": "As moves go, it’s a lot more powerful than\nBubble. The number of bubbles it spews out\nis really amazing!",
    "ch0110_01_kasumi/0604_0702_03_10": "Next time we battle, I’ll show you what I’m\ntalking about!",
    "ch0110_01_kasumi/0605_0701_01_10": "I’ve done a lot of traveling, even before\ncoming here to Pasio.",
    "ch0110_01_kasumi/0605_0701_02_10": "But ever since I teamed up with you,\nI’ve felt like my Pokémon and I have\nbecome closer than ever before.",
    "ch0110_01_kasumi/0605_0701_03_10": "Battling on a team with you has helped me\nrealize so many things I never noticed before.",
    "ch0110_01_kasumi/0605_0701_04_10": "I’m so glad I decided to come to Pasio!\nAnd thank you!",
    "ch0110_01_kasumi/0605_0702_01_10": "For a long time, it was my dream to go off on\na journey and battle against tough Trainers...",

    "ch0110_01_kasumi/1701_0701_02_10": "Here, this is from me.\nMake sure you take good care of it, OK?",
    "ch0110_01_kasumi/1701_0702_01_10": "I don’t know why, but giving people presents\nalways feels a little embarrassing.",
    "ch0110_01_kasumi/1701_0702_02_10": "Anyway, now that you have it,\nyou’ll have to decide how best to use it!",
    "ch0110_01_kasumi/2501_0701_01_10": "If you want to be better friends with your\nPokémon, my advice to you is to train in\nan environment that it likes!",
    "ch0110_01_kasumi/2501_0701_02_10": "I use Water-type Pokémon, so I end up at\nthe beach more often than not.",
    "ch0110_01_kasumi/2501_0701_03_10": "For us, swimming, surfing, and spending\ntime together there is really important.",
    "ch0110_01_kasumi/2501_0702_01_10": "Hmm... Should I buy a new swimsuit or\nsome new clothes for training...",
    "ch0110_01_kasumi/2501_0702_02_10": "When it comes to self-improvement and\nlooking good, I never spare any expense.",
    "ch0110_01_kasumi/2501_0702_03_10": "Working on yourself is just as important\nas working on your Pokémon!",
    "ch0110_01_kasumi/2511_0701_01_10": "Have you gotten used to Pasio yet?\nFor being an artificial island, it sure is huge.",
    "ch0110_01_kasumi/2511_0701_02_10": "Do you have a favorite spot that you\nlike to go to? If you do some exploring,\nyou might discover someplace new!",
    "ch0110_01_kasumi/2511_0701_03_10": "There aren’t any wild Pokémon to catch here,\nbut battling with all the different Trainers is\nactually a lot of fun!",
    "ch0110_01_kasumi/2511_0702_01_10": "The sunsets on Pasio are so pretty.",
    "ch0110_01_kasumi/2511_0702_02_10": "I’ve always loved gazing out at the sunset\nback home on the Cerulean Cape, too.",
    "ch0110_01_kasumi/2511_0702_03_10": "I feel like it’s giving me a push—\nlike it’s telling me to do my best tomorrow, too!",
    "ch0110_01_kasumi/3001_0701_01_10": "Morning! Starmie and I were just about\nto go out for some early training!",
    "ch0110_01_kasumi/3002_0701_01_10": "A quick swim right after you wake up \nis a perfect, refreshing start to the day!",
    "ch0110_01_kasumi/3003_0701_01_10": "Hey! Are you free right now?\nHow about a quick swim?",
    "ch0110_01_kasumi/3004_0701_01_10": "Snack time’s over! Time to get out there\nand use up all this energy! Wanna battle?",
    "ch0110_01_kasumi/3005_0701_01_10": "Are you going out to train at this hour?\nHave fun, but don’t overdo it!",
    "ch0110_01_kasumi/3006_0701_01_10": "Man, I don’t feel sleepy at all yet!\nMaybe it’s because I took a nap while\nsurfing with my Pokémon earlier...",
