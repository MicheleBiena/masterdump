    "charaepi_ch0130_10_serena/2301_1201_1000_10": "That Pokémon you stole... It’s eager to get back\nto its Trainer.",

    "charaepi_ch0130_10_serena/2301_1201_2900_10": "I know, right? They remind me of some other\npeople I know.",
    "charaepi_ch0130_10_serena/2301_1201_3000_10": "I met them when I was traveling through Kalos.\nSi... *cough*",
    "charaepi_ch0130_10_serena/2301_1201_3100_10": "Strange... They were very strange people.",

    "charaepi_ch0130_10_serena/2301_0401_3300_10": "Yeah. Or at least I thought so!",
    "charaepi_ch0130_10_serena/2301_0302_3400_10": "Who are you talking about?",
    "charaepi_ch0130_10_serena/2301_0402_3500_10": "Oh, never mind! Forget I said anything.",

    "charaepi_ch0130_10_serena/2301_1201_3700_10": "Anyway, I think Pasio’s a great environment for\nstudying Zygarde.",

    "charaepi_ch0130_10_serena/2301_1201_4100_10": "I wanted to go shopping today.",
    "charaepi_ch0130_10_serena/2301_1201_4200_10": "I need to find some cute accessories to go with\nmy new outfit!",
    "charaepi_ch0130_10_serena/2301_1201_4300_10": "You could have mentioned that...",
    "charaepi_ch0130_10_serena/2301_1201_4400_10": "Researching Zygarde is important, but I still wanna\nhave fun with my own hobbies—like fashion!",
    "charaepi_ch0130_10_serena/2301_1201_4500_10": "This sygna suit is proof of the bond I share with\nZygarde, but it’s also an outfit I can enjoy myself!",
    "charaepi_ch0130_10_serena/2301_1201_4600_10": "I guess that makes sense... And taking a break\nhere and there is probably for the best.",
    "charaepi_ch0130_10_serena/2301_1201_4700_10": "Exactly! Come on, let’s go!",
    "charaepi_ch0130_10_serena/2301_1201_4800_10": "Bet I can find you a new outfit that’ll match your\nstyle today, too!",
