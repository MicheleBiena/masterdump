    "ch0112_10_hibiki/0101_0701_02_10": "I like walking, but sometimes flying through the sky\nisn’t a bad way to travel, either!",
    "ch0112_10_hibiki/7101_0701_01_10": "Hey there! Isn’t this sygna suit slick?",
    "ch0112_10_hibiki/7101_0701_02_10": "The design even matches Lugia! We’re in\nperfect unison!",
    "ch0112_10_hibiki/7101_0701_03_10": "The rush I get when adventuring in this sygna suit\nis the best!",
    "ch0112_10_hibiki/7102_0701_01_10": "The ocean and sky on Pasio are so beautiful,\nit makes flying with Lugia even more fun!",
    "ch0112_10_hibiki/7102_0701_02_10": "Maybe one day, Lugia and I can explore the\nocean together. What do you think? Is that a bit\ntoo reckless?",
    "ch0112_10_hibiki/7103_0701_01_10": "Lyra is a childhood friend—and also my rival.",
    "ch0112_10_hibiki/7103_0701_02_10": "So of course I don’t want to lose to her in\nbattle...",
    "ch0112_10_hibiki/7103_0701_03_10": "We’re also about the same height, so we’re rivals\nin that as well!",
    "ch0112_10_hibiki/7104_0701_01_10": "According to the Pokédex, Lugia lives deep at the\nbottom of the sea.",
    "ch0112_10_hibiki/7104_0701_02_10": "Apparently, Lugia lives there to contain its powers\nand not disturb its surroundings.",
    "ch0112_10_hibiki/7104_0701_03_10": "That’s why I want to let it battle to its heart’s\ncontent here on Pasio!",
    "ch0112_10_hibiki/7105_0701_01_10": "It’s said that Lugia appears in a place called the\nWhirl Islands in Johto.",
    "ch0112_10_hibiki/7105_0701_02_10": "The huge whirlpools there are incredibly powerful\nand loud.",
    "ch0112_10_hibiki/7105_0701_03_10": "It’s a sight to behold! If you come to Johto, I’d be\nhappy to show you around!",
    "ch0112_10_hibiki/1701_0701_01_10": "Here, take this! I found it while flying with Lugia.",
    "ch0112_10_hibiki/1701_0702_01_10": "Use it when the time is right!",
    "ch0112_10_hibiki/2501_0701_01_10": "I thought I had grown from all of my experiences\ntraveling in Johto.",
    "ch0112_10_hibiki/2501_0701_02_10": "My Pokémon and I grew together. But then I came\nto Pasio.",
    "ch0112_10_hibiki/2501_0701_03_10": "And after watching you and all the other sync\npairs here, I realized I still have a lot more\nroom to grow!",
    "ch0112_10_hibiki/2501_0702_01_10": "Do adventures ever end? No matter how\nfar I travel, there’s always something new\nto discover!",
    "ch0112_10_hibiki/2501_0702_02_10": "At this rate, I’ll still be flying around the world\nwhen I’m an old man!",
    "ch0112_10_hibiki/2511_0701_01_10": "I dunno if you’ve realized, but Pasio is an\nextraordinary place.",
    "ch0112_10_hibiki/2511_0701_02_10": "All of the natural features of this island were\nbuilt from scratch, but they come together\nso beautifully.",
    "ch0112_10_hibiki/2511_0701_03_10": "It’s a miraculous balance! As an adventurer, I find\nit exciting!",
    "ch0112_10_hibiki/2511_0702_01_10": "When I lie down on the ground on Pasio,\nclose my eyes, and feel the wind...",
    "ch0112_10_hibiki/2511_0702_02_10": "I start to think that it doesn’t matter if it’s artificial\nor natural.",
    "ch0112_10_hibiki/2511_0702_03_10": "As long as nature, people, and Pokémon can all\nthrive side by side...",
    "ch0112_10_hibiki/2511_0702_04_10": "To me, that’s what’s most important!",
    "ch0112_10_hibiki/3001_0701_01_10": "When you feel groggy in the morning, try\nstretching your arms out like a giant Pokémon\nspreading its wings!",
    "ch0112_10_hibiki/3003_0701_01_10": "Come on! There’s a whole world full of dreams\nand adventures waiting for you just outside!",
