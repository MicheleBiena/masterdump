    "ch0031_00_fuu/0101_0701_02_10": "I’m always looking forward to seeing you!",
    "ch0031_00_fuu/0601_0701_01_10": "My Solrock has been full of energy\never since we came here.",
    "ch0031_00_fuu/0601_0701_02_10": "Can you feel it?\nThat crackling, popping sensation?",
    "ch0031_00_fuu/0601_0701_03_10": "You can tell how your Pokémon is feeling,\neven without any special powers!",
    "ch0031_00_fuu/0601_0702_01_10": "Knowing how each other feels is an\namazing power!",
    "ch0031_00_fuu/0601_0702_02_10": "You definitely need it to work \nhard together at something.",
    "ch0031_00_fuu/0602_0701_01_10": "Liza and I are totally in sync!\nBut well...",
    "ch0031_00_fuu/0602_0701_02_10": "we got into a huge fight once, when Liza lost\none of my toys.",
    "ch0031_00_fuu/0602_0701_03_10": "She kept quiet about it for so long!\nEven though she knew she couldn’t really hide\nit from me!",
    "ch0031_00_fuu/0602_0701_04_10": "But well, I ended up forgiving her.\nShe apologized to me, and besides, she’s the\nonly twin sister I’ve got!",
    "ch0031_00_fuu/0602_0702_01_10": "I’ve started a fight with Liza, too, actually.\nI ate her snack without asking her.",
    "ch0031_00_fuu/0602_0702_02_10": "Heh!\nI can tell by your look, you think Liza and I\naren’t too different, right?",
    "ch0031_00_fuu/0603_0701_01_10": "Solrock doesn’t really change its expression.",
    "ch0031_00_fuu/0603_0701_02_10": "So it expresses itself using its\nwhole body!",
    "ch0031_00_fuu/0603_0701_03_10": "That’s why I want to show it how I feel using\nbody language, too—not just words.",
    "ch0031_00_fuu/0603_0702_01_10": "It’s difficult to show your feelings using your\nwhole body like Solrock does...",
    "ch0031_00_fuu/0603_0702_02_10": "But when I’m with Solrock, it’s like we’re\ndancing together. It’s a lot of fun!",
    "ch0031_00_fuu/0604_0701_01_10": "There was a time when Liza and I swapped\nclothing and hairstyles.",
    "ch0031_00_fuu/0604_0701_02_10": "I ended up being sent to a place where there\nwere only girls.",
    "ch0031_00_fuu/0604_0701_03_10": "Liza said she had fun, but I was so embarrassed.",
    "ch0031_00_fuu/0604_0702_01_10": "Liza says she wants to do it again, but\nI dunno.",
    "ch0031_00_fuu/0604_0702_02_10": "Hmmm. Well, if it’ll make Liza happy, maybe\nI’ll give it a go again. Even if it means I’ll\nget embarrassed again.",
    "ch0031_00_fuu/1701_0701_01_10": "You always keep me company, so...\nHere! A present for you!",
    "ch0031_00_fuu/1701_0701_02_10": "Heh heh heh, I tried to pick something perfect.\nI hope you like it!",
    "ch0031_00_fuu/1701_0702_01_10": "I didn’t ask anybody for advice, you know?\nI picked it all by myself! I was a little nervous.",
    "ch0031_00_fuu/2501_0701_01_10": "Liza and I help out at the Space Center sometimes.",
    "ch0031_00_fuu/2501_0701_02_10": "And they bought me a cool toy as a reward!",
    "ch0031_00_fuu/2501_0701_03_10": "It was so cool, I carried it around everywhere,\nand now I accidentally brought it here with me.\nDon’t tell Liza!",
    "ch0031_00_fuu/2501_0702_01_10": "They told me at the Space Center that the\nuniverse is full of mysteries.",
    "ch0031_00_fuu/2501_0702_02_10": "I hope I can go to space someday.",
    "ch0031_00_fuu/2511_0701_01_10": "I’m glad I was able to battle with you.",
    "ch0031_00_fuu/2511_0701_02_10": "I always team up with Liza, so there\nare a lot of things I never realized before.",
    "ch0031_00_fuu/2511_0701_03_10": "I want to learn lots more and become\neven stronger!",
    "ch0031_00_fuu/2511_0702_01_10": "Liza told me she also learned a lot by teaming\nup with different people.",
    "ch0031_00_fuu/2511_0702_02_10": "Maybe I should challenge her to a battle?\nI want to see how strong we’ve gotten!",
    "ch0031_00_fuu/3001_0701_01_10": "Good morning!\nYou look wide awake. I was just wondering\nwhat kind of fun I could have today.",
    "ch0031_00_fuu/3002_0701_01_10": "Morning!\nA nice early greeting really wakes me up!",
    "ch0031_00_fuu/3003_0701_01_10": "Hello! Nice day, isn’t it.\nPerfect for a Pokémon battle!",
    "ch0031_00_fuu/3004_0701_01_10": "Hey! I always get hungry for\na snack around this time...",
    "ch0031_00_fuu/3005_0701_01_10": "Good evening!\nYou’re here late. Don’t work too hard.",
    "ch0031_00_fuu/3006_0701_01_10": "*yawn*\nOh! No, I’m not tired! I’m fine!",
