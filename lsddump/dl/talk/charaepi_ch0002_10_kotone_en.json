    "charaepi_ch0002_10_kotone/2301_0302_1000_10": "We heard singing.",
    "charaepi_ch0002_10_kotone/2301_0402_1100_10": "Oh, is that how you ended up here—following\nthe singing? That was Celebi!",

    "charaepi_ch0002_10_kotone/2301_1201_2000_10": "Maybe Celebi remembers seeing someone singing\nand dancing in the woods.",
    "charaepi_ch0002_10_kotone/2301_1201_2100_10": "Perhaps. It must have met so many different\npeople and Pokémon throughout the ages...",
    "charaepi_ch0002_10_kotone/2301_1201_2200_10": "so I suppose it’s had more than its fair share\nof farewells.",

    "charaepi_ch0002_10_kotone/2301_1201_2900_10": "I know! Why don’t we all dance together like those\ndancers from long ago?",
    "charaepi_ch0002_10_kotone/2301_1201_3000_10": "Maybe that’ll make Celebi feel a little less lonely!",
