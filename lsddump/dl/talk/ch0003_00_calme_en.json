    "ch0003_00_calme/0101_0701_02_10": "Want to see which one of us can get\nstronger today?",
    "ch0003_00_calme/0601_0701_01_10": "My partner, Espurr, is a pretty popular Pokémon\nin the Kalos region.",
    "ch0003_00_calme/0601_0701_02_10": "A lot of people keep them out of their\nPoké Balls, since they’re so friendly\nand affectionate.",
    "ch0003_00_calme/0601_0701_03_10": "Of course, they’re also great in battle.\nYou should see what mine can do!",
    "ch0003_00_calme/0601_0701_04_10": "He’s my trusted partner, and we aim \nto become stronger together.",
    "ch0003_00_calme/0601_0702_01_10": "Only great Trainers like me can have\nEspurr as a partner.",
    "ch0003_00_calme/0601_0702_02_10": "Mine does have a sweet tooth, though.\nHe’s snuck off with my snacks more than once.",
    "ch0003_00_calme/0603_0701_01_10": "Pasio is a completely different world from Kalos.",
    "ch0003_00_calme/0603_0701_02_10": "I wonder... I trained pretty hard in Kalos,\nbut how far will those skills take me here?",
    "ch0003_00_calme/0603_0701_03_10": "To be honest, I’m scared to find out—but more\nthan that, I’m excited!",
    "ch0003_00_calme/0603_0702_01_10": "I will overcome any obstacle Pasio throws at me!",
    "ch0003_00_calme/0603_0702_02_10": "I wear this hat to remind me of how determined\nI am. As long as I’m wearing it, I won’t forget!",
    "ch0003_00_calme/0604_0701_01_10": "Having good teamwork is tricky, isn’t it?\nDifferent Trainers and Pokémon move at\ndifferent rhythms and everything.",
    "ch0003_00_calme/0604_0701_02_10": "When you think about it, you’re able to sync up\nimmediately with lots of different Trainers.\nThat’s a kind of talent, you know?",
    "ch0003_00_calme/0604_0701_03_10": "I hope you keep on strengthening your talents.",
    "ch0003_00_calme/0604_0701_04_10": "I think that’s how you’ll get stronger.",

    "ch0003_00_calme/0604_0702_02_10": "It’s no fun if everyone is the same, anyway.\nI hope you look forward to seeing what my\nstrengths are when it’s time for us to battle!",
    "ch0003_00_calme/0605_0701_01_10": "I don’t know what it is you’re aiming for,\n[Name:PlayerNickname ].",
    "ch0003_00_calme/0605_0701_02_10": "It may even be that you’re not sure yourself.",
    "ch0003_00_calme/0605_0701_03_10": "But even then, I still believe that we’ll end\nup reaching the same place.",
    "ch0003_00_calme/0605_0702_01_10": "There are many different ways for people and\nPokémon to interact. Same goes for people\ninteracting with people, of course.",
    "ch0003_00_calme/0605_0702_02_10": "Let’s work together to try to figure out\nwhich way is best.",
    "ch0003_00_calme/1701_0701_01_10": "Oh, there you are.\nHere, I’ve got a present for you.",
    "ch0003_00_calme/1701_0701_02_10": "I want us to get strong together, so\nI hope you put it to good use.",

    "ch0003_00_calme/1701_0702_02_10": "The only thing I want is for you to get stronger.",
    "ch0003_00_calme/2501_0701_01_10": "There are some moves that are easy to use,\nbut why don’t you try out moves \nyou’ve never used before?",
    "ch0003_00_calme/2501_0701_02_10": "You might come up with new strategies, and\nthat’ll help battles go a lot smoother.",
    "ch0003_00_calme/2501_0701_03_10": "Before you ask, no, I’m not going to tell you\nwhat strategies I use.",
    "ch0003_00_calme/2501_0701_04_10": "You’re one of my best opponents!\nI want to keep my strategies a secret until\nit’s time to actually battle you.",
    "ch0003_00_calme/2501_0702_01_10": "Isn’t it great to have someone you really want\nto beat in a battle?",
    "ch0003_00_calme/2501_0702_02_10": "It’s a goal for you to pursue—\nto strive for that victory.",
    "ch0003_00_calme/2501_0702_03_10": "I hope you keep getting stronger.\nBecause I plan on going even further than that!",

    "ch0003_00_calme/2511_0701_02_10": "She’s a pretty dependable girl—always\nsays exactly what’s on her mind.",
    "ch0003_00_calme/2511_0701_03_10": "Personalities aside, you have a lot in common\nwith her. Your strength, how you battle—\nthat kind of thing.",
    "ch0003_00_calme/2511_0701_04_10": "Maybe that’s why I get so stubborn about\nbeating you. I just don’t want to lose.",
    "ch0003_00_calme/2511_0702_01_10": "Serena used to be pretty quiet when we \nfirst met. Her personality changed only recently.",
    "ch0003_00_calme/2511_0702_02_10": "People tell me she totally calls the shots\nin our relationship.",
    "ch0003_00_calme/2511_0702_03_10": "It’s not like that, though. \nShe’s just dead set on going her own way. \nBesides, it’s not like we’re in a “relationship!”",
    "ch0003_00_calme/2511_0702_04_10": "Man, people do change quickly.",
    "ch0003_00_calme/3001_0701_01_10": "Morning. I see you’re an early riser as well.\nI admire that.",
    "ch0003_00_calme/3002_0701_01_10": "My Pokémon and I are always ready to go,\nmorning, noon, or night!",
    "ch0003_00_calme/3003_0701_01_10": "Hi there. \nI’m glad to see your Pokémon \nhappy and healthy.",
    "ch0003_00_calme/3004_0701_01_10": "Hmm... It’s important to take a break \nnow and again, I suppose.",
    "ch0003_00_calme/3005_0701_01_10": "How’s it going?\nI’ve been doing some extra training at night.",
    "ch0003_00_calme/3006_0701_01_10": "You’re out late, aren’t you.\nI can keep you company for a bit.",
