    "charaepi_ch0090_00_daigo/2301_1201_2900_10": "But I believe there’s a well of even greater\npotential hidden within these stones.",

    "charaepi_ch0090_00_daigo/2301_1201_4400_10": "Just like how polishing a gemstone makes\nit sparkle, it seems we sync pairs need to\nhone our skills in order to shine as well!",
    "charaepi_ch0090_00_daigo/2301_1201_4500_10": "Please, will you join me again sometime soon?\nI’d like to polish our battling skills together!",
