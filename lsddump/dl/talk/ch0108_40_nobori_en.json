    "ch0108_40_nobori/7101_0701_01_10": "This outfit feels different from my Battle Subway\nuniform. I feel competent and put together!",
    "ch0108_40_nobori/7101_0701_02_10": "I feel like I could complete any task to perfection\nwearing this!",
    "ch0108_40_nobori/7101_0701_03_10": "In the meantime... May I offer you something\nto drink?",

    "ch0108_40_nobori/3001_0701_01_10": "Are you heading out for the day? I wish I had\nyour energy this early in the morning. I’d better\ntrain harder, or you’ll pass me right up.",
