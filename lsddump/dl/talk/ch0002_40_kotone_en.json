    "ch0002_40_kotone/2511_0702_01_10": "Maybe I’m already teaching you things without\nhaving to put it into words.",
    "ch0002_40_kotone/2511_0702_02_10": "Yeah...that’s gotta be it!",
    "ch0002_40_kotone/2511_0702_03_10": "It would make me so happy if the things I’m doing\nwere helpful to you, even a little!",
