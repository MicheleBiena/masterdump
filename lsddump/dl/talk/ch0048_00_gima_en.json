    "ch0048_00_gima/0601_0701_03_10": "It glides through the battlefield regally,\nlike shuffling a deck of cards.",
    "ch0048_00_gima/0601_0701_04_10": "The way it seems to own the battle with its\ncharm has made it one of my favorite Pokémon\nto battle with.",
    "ch0048_00_gima/0601_0702_01_10": "I hope someday you, too, will discover a Pokémon\nthat draws your gaze with its beauty and charm\nin battle.",
    "ch0048_00_gima/0601_0702_02_10": "When you do, I have a feeling you’ll develop a\nnew thirst for victory within you as well.",
    "ch0048_00_gima/0602_0701_01_10": "I’m fond of a great many Pokémon...",
    "ch0048_00_gima/0602_0701_02_10": "but it’s Liepard’s strength that I’d risk it all on.",
    "ch0048_00_gima/0602_0701_03_10": "The way she pounces with devastating blows\nfaster than her opponents can predict them...",
    "ch0048_00_gima/0602_0701_04_10": "Sure, there’s always some manner of luck\ninvolved—but that just adds to the flavor.",

    "ch0048_00_gima/0603_0701_04_10": "I suppose that’s a foolish question—the natural\nresponse of any Trainer would be themselves,\nof course.",
    "ch0048_00_gima/0603_0702_01_10": "If I had to wager a guess at who lady luck favors\nmost, besides myself...",
    "ch0048_00_gima/0603_0702_02_10": "well, I suppose I’d wager on you—hypothetically,\nof course. You have potential. I see great things in\nyour future.",
    "ch0048_00_gima/0603_0702_03_10": "Why not cast your lot with me, and we can claim\nvictory together?",
    "ch0048_00_gima/0604_0701_01_10": "In a Pokémon battle, we seek victory—\nnever defeat.",
    "ch0048_00_gima/0604_0701_02_10": "For us, battling with our Pokémon is a way to\nsatisfy our desire to win—to get what we want.",
    "ch0048_00_gima/0604_0701_03_10": "I don’t let myself get distracted by losses or grow\nbigheaded when victorious—I simply seek to win\nmy next battle.",
    "ch0048_00_gima/0604_0701_04_10": "That is my pure and honest desire, and I have no\nneed to hesitate.",

    "ch0048_00_gima/0605_0701_01_10": "You like Pokémon, don’t you?",
    "ch0048_00_gima/0605_0701_02_10": "I love Pokémon more than anything else in the\nworld, as all Trainers do...",
    "ch0048_00_gima/0605_0701_03_10": "but let me get one thing off my chest.",
    "ch0048_00_gima/0605_0701_04_10": "Battles can be used to settle a lot of\ndifferent things.",
    "ch0048_00_gima/0605_0701_05_10": "However, battling others just to profess that your\nlove is better than theirs... That’s just deplorable.",
    "ch0048_00_gima/0605_0702_01_10": "Telling someone that their feelings are wrong—or\ngetting in the way of someone else’s love—is not\na nice thing to do.",

    "ch0048_00_gima/2501_0701_02_10": "are all impeccable choices, the way I see it. You\nknow how it feels to thirst for victory and triumph.",
    "ch0048_00_gima/2501_0701_03_10": "From my perspective, it looks like you still have\nsome room to grow when it comes to following\nthrough on the battlefield...",
    "ch0048_00_gima/2501_0701_04_10": "but if that’s just your playfulness that I’m seeing,\nthen perhaps I’m wrong. ",
    "ch0048_00_gima/2501_0702_01_10": "After all, having a thirst for victory is not a bad\nthing in and of itself...",
    "ch0048_00_gima/2501_0702_02_10": "but if you can afford to have some fun along\nthe way, it should be encouraged.",
    "ch0048_00_gima/2501_0702_03_10": "A bit of adventurousness can be the ace up your\nsleeve, you know. I can appreciate that in a\nbattle opponent.",

    "ch0048_00_gima/2511_0701_02_10": "You see, the strongest Trainers know they’ll\neventually have to face one another, and that\ndoesn’t lend itself to chummy teamwork.",
    "ch0048_00_gima/2511_0701_03_10": "That being said, teaming up with you and\nclaiming victory together versus individually...\nThat has its own brilliant shine.",
    "ch0048_00_gima/2511_0701_04_10": "I want to experience more of that shine.",
    "ch0048_00_gima/2511_0702_01_10": "Being a Pokémon Trainer isn’t something you can\ndo alone.",
    "ch0048_00_gima/2511_0702_02_10": "You always have your Pokémon fighting\nthere beside you. You can’t have a real\nbattle otherwise.",
    "ch0048_00_gima/2511_0702_03_10": "In order to win, you have to be able to trust your\nPokémon and your Pokémon has to have faith\nin you.",
    "ch0048_00_gima/2511_0702_04_10": "The Trainers who possess the strongest trust are\nthe ones who will win—particularly here on Pasio\nwith this many Trainers competing.",
    "ch0048_00_gima/3001_0701_01_10": "Good morning. Something tells me luck’s on our\nside today.",
    "ch0048_00_gima/3002_0701_01_10": "I’m not really a morning person...\nI tend to stay up late battling most nights.",
    "ch0048_00_gima/3003_0701_01_10": "Eating a proper meal should be your first step to\nprepare for battle.",
    "ch0048_00_gima/3004_0701_01_10": "I study new moves during the day—and then\nbattle with them at night. That’s my style.",
    "ch0048_00_gima/3005_0701_01_10": "Dark nights are for daredevils like me.\nAre you a daredevil, too?",
    "ch0048_00_gima/3006_0701_01_10": "Some people say nights are calm and relaxing,\nbut for a thrill-seeker like me, they get the\nblood pumping.",
