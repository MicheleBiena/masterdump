    "ch0089_00_n/0101_0701_02_10": "Your friend is saying they’re excited and that they\ncan’t wait to go on an adventure.",
    "ch0089_00_n/0601_0701_01_10": "When I was little, I was separated from other\nhumans and raised by Pokémon.",
    "ch0089_00_n/0601_0701_02_10": "That’s why I wanted to liberate them from being\nconfined in Poké Balls.",
    "ch0089_00_n/0601_0701_03_10": "It was all for the sake of Pokémon—my friends.",
    "ch0089_00_n/0602_0701_01_10": "Humans and Pokémon alike should be freed from\nthe oppression of Poké Balls.",
    "ch0089_00_n/0602_0701_02_10": "And we should create an ideal world, where\nhumans and Pokémon trust and help each other...",
    "ch0089_00_n/0602_0701_03_10": "I want to create a world like that. That’s why I\nleft on a journey.",
    "ch0089_00_n/0602_0701_04_10": "Eventually, I found my way to Pasio.",
    "ch0089_00_n/0602_0701_05_10": "When I first saw this place, I knew then that my\nideals were not mistaken.",
    "ch0089_00_n/0603_0701_01_10": "The artificial island of Pasio is truly a\nmagnificent place.",
    "ch0089_00_n/0603_0701_02_10": "The form of the land, the architecture, even the\narrangement of nature itself—it’s all perfect.",
    "ch0089_00_n/0603_0701_03_10": "Nature is normally the result of formulas too\nelegant to be dismissed as mere coincidence.",
    "ch0089_00_n/0603_0701_04_10": "To reproduce something like that, one must\nmeticulously check their calculations for every\npossible variable.",
    "ch0089_00_n/0603_0701_05_10": "It’s no easy feat, which is why I’m pleasantly\nsurprised to see it happen on an artificial island\nlike Pasio.",
    "ch0089_00_n/0604_0701_01_10": "I can hear the voices of my friends—Pokémon.",
    "ch0089_00_n/0604_0701_02_10": "Just like humans, Pokémon can feel emotions.\nAnger, sadness, suffering...",
    "ch0089_00_n/0604_0701_03_10": "Your friend can feel those emotions, too.",
    "ch0089_00_n/0605_0701_01_10": "Battles do nothing more than hurt Pokémon...",
    "ch0089_00_n/0605_0701_02_10": "That’s how I understood it in the past—and why\nI hated battles. But I know now that it’s not\nthat simple.",
    "ch0089_00_n/0605_0701_03_10": "Pokémon battles decide winners and losers, it’s\ntrue. Yet they do so much more.",
    "ch0089_00_n/0605_0701_04_10": "A Pokémon battle is a way for us to see what\nwonderful things others have to contribute. ",
    "ch0089_00_n/1701_0701_01_10": "Here, take this. I’m sure it will be helpful.",
    "ch0089_00_n/1701_0702_01_10": "How you use an item you receive from someone\nelse is up to you.",
    "ch0089_00_n/1701_0702_02_10": "I hope that you’re getting closer to achieving\nyour ideals.",
    "ch0089_00_n/2501_0701_01_10": "In the past, I met a Trainer whose feelings were\nstrong enough to change the world.",
    "ch0089_00_n/2501_0701_02_10": "That Trainer was recognized as a new hero\nfor wanting a world where humans and\nPokémon coexist.",
    "ch0089_00_n/2501_0701_03_10": "I wonder how much love that Trainer has filled\ntheir world with.",
    "ch0089_00_n/2501_0701_04_10": "That’s something I’d like to see.",
    "ch0089_00_n/2501_0702_01_10": "Come to think of it, you somehow remind me\nof that Trainer.",
    "ch0089_00_n/2501_0702_02_10": "If you ask me what about you is the same, I’m\nafraid I can’t say what exactly.",
    "ch0089_00_n/2501_0702_03_10": "Perhaps...it’s your love of Pokémon?",
    "ch0089_00_n/2511_0701_01_10": "[Name:PlayerNickname ], I have a question for\nyou. Is there something you think Pasio is lacking?",
    "ch0089_00_n/2511_0701_02_10": "I think it needs a ferris wheel.",
    "ch0089_00_n/2511_0701_03_10": "I have no clue why such a complete and\ndeveloped island wouldn’t have one. ",
    "ch0089_00_n/2511_0701_04_10": "I just don’t get it.",
    "ch0089_00_n/2511_0702_01_10": "I love ferris wheels. The circular motion...\nThe mechanics... They’re like collections of\nelegant formulas.",
    "ch0089_00_n/2511_0702_02_10": "Furthermore, we’d get to see more of Pasio’s\nwonderful scenery.",
    "ch0089_00_n/2511_0702_03_10": "Pasio would become even more beautiful with a\nferris wheel. That’s what I think, anyway.",
    "ch0089_00_n/2511_0702_04_10": "If they ever do build a ferris wheel here,\n[Name:PlayerNickname ], let’s ride it together.",
    "ch0089_00_n/3001_0701_01_10": "Have you ever noticed the shapes and angles of\nPasio’s architecture? The city, the stadium...\nThey’re like a collection of elegant formulas.",
    "ch0089_00_n/3003_0701_01_10": "As someone who pursues his ideals, all I can do\neach day is continue to follow what I believe is\nmy true path.",
    "ch0089_00_n/3005_0701_01_10": "Your Pokémon... It was just saying how much it\nlikes you—and how it’s happy to be with you.\n",
