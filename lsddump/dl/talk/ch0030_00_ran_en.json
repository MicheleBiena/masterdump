    "ch0030_00_ran/0101_0701_02_10": "Come on! Each day of training counts!\nYou have to give it your best today, too!",
    "ch0030_00_ran/0601_0701_01_10": "Pokémon that use Psychic-type moves tend to be\na little strange.",
    "ch0030_00_ran/0601_0701_02_10": "Back in the Hoenn region, I met the Clay Doll\nPokémon Baltoy when I was smaller.",
    "ch0030_00_ran/0601_0701_03_10": "It didn’t move at all, so I got curious\nand decided to keep watching it.",
    "ch0030_00_ran/0601_0701_04_10": "But then it suddenly let out a loud cry! It was \nlike that was a signal or something. A whole \nbunch of Baltoy started gathering around!",
    "ch0030_00_ran/0601_0701_05_10": "I only barely managed to run away before\nI got swallowed up in the swarm.",
    "ch0030_00_ran/0601_0702_01_10": "My Lunatone acts strange sometimes, too.\nWhen it’s a full moon, it starts spinning around\nreally fast!",
    "ch0030_00_ran/0601_0702_02_10": "I tried to get it to settle down, but it won’t\nstop. I wonder what that’s all about.",
    "ch0030_00_ran/0602_0701_01_10": "Lunatone is my friend.\nIt’s been with me for a long time!",
    "ch0030_00_ran/0602_0701_02_10": "It’s really important to me—just like the\nmoon itself!",
    "ch0030_00_ran/0602_0701_03_10": "It’s so big and pretty!\nIt’s a wonderful family member to me!",
    "ch0030_00_ran/0602_0702_01_10": "Hee hee, Lunatone seems like it’s in a good\nmood today!",
    "ch0030_00_ran/0602_0702_02_10": "I don’t need telepathy to tell what it’s\nthinking. We’re family after all!",
    "ch0030_00_ran/0603_0701_01_10": "There are lots of things I really like!",
    "ch0030_00_ran/0603_0701_02_10": "I like Lunatone, of course, and I like you, too.\nI like so many things, I can’t count them all!",
    "ch0030_00_ran/0603_0701_03_10": "But right now, I think I really like Pasio’s\ntoy stores!",
    "ch0030_00_ran/0603_0701_04_10": "Time flies when I visit, even if I’m just looking!",
    "ch0030_00_ran/0603_0702_01_10": "If I spend too long looking at toys,\nsometimes Lunatone gets jealous.",
    "ch0030_00_ran/0603_0702_02_10": "Hee hee, isn’t that silly?\nOf course Lunatone is more important than\nsome silly toy!",
    "ch0030_00_ran/0604_0701_01_10": "It’s a lot of fun to jump around riding Spoink,\nyou know?",
    "ch0030_00_ran/0604_0701_02_10": "Spoink tails are like springs, and they can use\nthem to jump really high!",
    "ch0030_00_ran/0604_0701_03_10": "But I need to be careful, ’cause sometimes they\nmove so quickly I get thrown off!",
    "ch0030_00_ran/0604_0701_04_10": "You need to get the...knack?\nYeah, the knack of it.",
    "ch0030_00_ran/0604_0702_01_10": "Jumping around with Spoink is fun, but\nyou can only do it when you’re a kid because\nadults are too heavy.",
    "ch0030_00_ran/0604_0702_02_10": "I need to make sure I have all the fun I can!",
    "ch0030_00_ran/0605_0701_01_10": "Hey, [Name:PlayerNickname ],\ncan you hear me out?",
    "ch0030_00_ran/0605_0701_02_10": "These days, I’ve started thinking about you more.\nLike, how you’re doing or...",
    "ch0030_00_ran/0605_0701_03_10": "what you’re up to... That sort of thing.",
    "ch0030_00_ran/0605_0701_04_10": "I think that’s why our combination’s getting\nbetter, too!",
    "ch0030_00_ran/0605_0702_01_10": "Never mind our combination. I just plain enjoy\nbeing around you!",
    "ch0030_00_ran/0605_0702_02_10": "It’s exciting when I think about what adventure\nwe’ll have together next!",
    "ch0030_00_ran/1701_0701_01_10": "Here’s a present for you, since you’re always\nworking so hard!",
    "ch0030_00_ran/1701_0701_02_10": "I think it’ll be useful to you!",
    "ch0030_00_ran/1701_0701_03_10": "I’m your friend. Of course I can tell \nwhat kind of thing you want!",
    "ch0030_00_ran/1701_0702_01_10": "I know you’ll use it well.\nThat gift comes from my heart, after all!",
    "ch0030_00_ran/2501_0701_01_10": "Tate and I sometimes help out with experiments\nat the Mossdeep Space Center!",
    "ch0030_00_ran/2501_0701_02_10": "They say our psychic powers are useful for\nthe experiments they perform.",
    "ch0030_00_ran/2501_0701_03_10": "And so we’re always happy to help out!",
    "ch0030_00_ran/2501_0701_04_10": "Besides, if we help out...",
    "ch0030_00_ran/2501_0701_05_10": "they buy us toys as rewards!",
    "ch0030_00_ran/2501_0702_01_10": "I’m not helping out with the experiments just\nfor the toys, OK?",
    "ch0030_00_ran/2501_0702_02_10": "That’s just a bonus!\nI really just want to help out the people\nin the Space Center!",
    "ch0030_00_ran/2501_0702_03_10": "It’s true!",
    "ch0030_00_ran/2511_0701_01_10": "I’ve always teamed up with Tate till now, but...",
    "ch0030_00_ran/2511_0701_02_10": "I’ve learned a lot through teaming up with\nyou, too!",
    "ch0030_00_ran/2511_0701_03_10": "I always thought that my combination with Tate\nwas perfect ’cause we were twins.",
    "ch0030_00_ran/2511_0701_04_10": "But I think I realize now there were a lot of\ntimes when Tate worked to stay in sync with me.",
    "ch0030_00_ran/2511_0701_05_10": "Just like how you try to keep in time with me!",
    "ch0030_00_ran/2511_0702_01_10": "Next time, when I team up with Tate again...",
    "ch0030_00_ran/2511_0702_02_10": "I think we’ll be able to show an even more\npowerful combination!",
    "ch0030_00_ran/3001_0701_01_10": "Good morning! Nice day, isn’t it.",
    "ch0030_00_ran/3002_0701_01_10": "I’m still not awake yet...",
    "ch0030_00_ran/3003_0701_01_10": "Hello!\nNice weather puts me in such a good mood!",
    "ch0030_00_ran/3004_0701_01_10": "Let’s play a lot and battle a lot!",
    "ch0030_00_ran/3005_0701_01_10": "Good evening! What a beautiful moon tonight!",
    "ch0030_00_ran/3006_0701_01_10": "I feel the power of the moon\nat this time of night.",
