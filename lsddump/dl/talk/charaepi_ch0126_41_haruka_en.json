    "charaepi_ch0126_41_haruka/2301_0302_1000_10": "I didn’t want to interrupt.",
    "charaepi_ch0126_41_haruka/2301_0402_1100_10": "I see, you were letting us focus on the battle.",
    "charaepi_ch0126_41_haruka/2301_1201_1200_10": "Although...it was more of Sabrina helping me train\nthan it was a battle.",
    "charaepi_ch0126_41_haruka/2301_1201_1300_10": "She seems really interested in Latias’s ability to\nread my emotions.",
    "charaepi_ch0126_41_haruka/2301_1201_1400_10": "So I asked her to have a battle with me.",

    "charaepi_ch0126_41_haruka/2301_0401_1700_10": "Yeah! My Latias has always loved hanging out and\nhaving fun with me!",
    "charaepi_ch0126_41_haruka/2301_0302_1800_10": "Did you not like battling?",
    "charaepi_ch0126_41_haruka/2301_0402_1900_10": "I wouldn’t say that. We just started out more\nlike playmates or friends.",
    "charaepi_ch0126_41_haruka/2301_1201_2000_10": "I met Latias one day while I was taking a break\nfrom doing fieldwork.",
    "charaepi_ch0126_41_haruka/2301_1201_2100_10": "I was feeding the Pokémon some candies called\nPokéblocks and playing with them when Latias\napproached me.",
    "charaepi_ch0126_41_haruka/2301_1201_2200_10": "Latias don’t usually appear in front of people, but\nthis one seems to be curious by nature.",
    "charaepi_ch0126_41_haruka/2301_1201_2300_10": "The more we played together, the deeper our\nfriendship became.",
    "charaepi_ch0126_41_haruka/2301_1201_2400_10": "But when I battled with my other Pokémon,\nI noticed that Latias would always stare at me.",
    "charaepi_ch0126_41_haruka/2301_1201_2500_10": "I started wondering why that could be...\nThen it hit me.",
    "charaepi_ch0126_41_haruka/2301_1201_2600_10": "Latias was trying to use her telepathy to tell me\nshe wanted to battle, too!",
    "charaepi_ch0126_41_haruka/2301_1201_2700_10": "Since then, we’ve sought out all sorts of Pokémon\nbattles together!",
    "charaepi_ch0126_41_haruka/2301_0301_2800_10": "Was that telepathy just now?",
    "charaepi_ch0126_41_haruka/2301_0401_2900_10": "No, it’s not exactly telepathy.",
    "charaepi_ch0126_41_haruka/2301_0302_3000_10": "Is Latias saying something now?",
    "charaepi_ch0126_41_haruka/2301_0402_3100_10": "I can’t really understand what she’s saying...",
    "charaepi_ch0126_41_haruka/2301_1201_3200_10": "But I can understand Latias’s thoughts.",
    "charaepi_ch0126_41_haruka/2301_1201_3300_10": "Even without using telepathy, I think I know exactly\nhow she feels.",
    "charaepi_ch0126_41_haruka/2301_1201_3400_10": "Chatting is nice and all, but battling sounds way\nmore fun!",
    "charaepi_ch0126_41_haruka/2301_0301_3500_10": "Let’s do it!",
    "charaepi_ch0126_41_haruka/2301_0401_3600_10": "Really? Awesome!",
    "charaepi_ch0126_41_haruka/2301_0302_3700_10": "Ready whenever!",

    "charaepi_ch0126_41_haruka/2301_1201_3900_10": "Let’s give it our all, Latias!",
    "charaepi_ch0126_41_haruka/2301_1201_4000_10": "We can test out what we learned from our\nlast battle!",
    "charaepi_ch0126_41_haruka/2301_1201_4100_10": "Time to show them how in sync we are on\nthe battlefield!",
