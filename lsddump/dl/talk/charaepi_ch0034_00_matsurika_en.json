    "charaepi_ch0034_00_matsurika/2301_1201_0400_10": "Oh, hey! That you, [Name:PlayerNickname ]?\nDidn’t realize it was you walking up here.",
    "charaepi_ch0034_00_matsurika/2301_1201_0500_10": "Pretty cool coincidence, though!",
    "charaepi_ch0034_00_matsurika/2301_0301_0600_10": "What’s up?",

    "charaepi_ch0034_00_matsurika/2301_1201_1100_10": "It’s a win-win situation. I get a model\nto paint, and posing like that gets Granbull\ninto a more competitive mind-set.",

    "charaepi_ch0034_00_matsurika/2301_0401_1800_10": "Yep! It’s a funny story, actually...\nSo, my Granbull has this habit of chomping on\nwhatever it is that makes him happy or excited.",
    "charaepi_ch0034_00_matsurika/2301_0302_1900_10": "What makes you think that?",

    "charaepi_ch0034_00_matsurika/2301_1201_2100_10": "And, like, the first time we saw an ad for the PML\non TV, he launched himself right up toward\nthe screen!",
    "charaepi_ch0034_00_matsurika/2301_1201_2200_10": "He was just going at it! Chomping and\nchomping and chomping on the TV...",
    "charaepi_ch0034_00_matsurika/2301_1201_2300_10": "And I was just, like, super shocked!\nIt all happened so fast, you know?",
    "charaepi_ch0034_00_matsurika/2301_1201_2400_10": "That wasn’t the only time he did it, either.\nEvery time the PML ad came on TV,\nhe’d run up and chomp away.",
    "charaepi_ch0034_00_matsurika/2301_1201_2500_10": "I was super touched when I realized how\neager my timid Granbull was to come to\na crowded place like this!",
    "charaepi_ch0034_00_matsurika/2301_1201_2600_10": "Even more reason for us to dominate in\nthe tournament. Better watch out—we’re\nnot gonna go easy on you, either!",
    "charaepi_ch0034_00_matsurika/2301_0301_2700_10": "Ditto!",
    "charaepi_ch0034_00_matsurika/2301_0401_2800_10": "You seem pretty strong, so we’ll be\ncomin’ at you with everything we’ve got.",

    "charaepi_ch0034_00_matsurika/2301_1201_3200_10": "Oh no—my painting!\nIt’s gonna get blown away!",
    "charaepi_ch0034_00_matsurika/2301_1201_3300_10": "Phew! Looks like Granbull caught it\njust in the nick of time!",
    "charaepi_ch0034_00_matsurika/2301_1201_3400_10": "I knew I could count on you, boy!",
    "charaepi_ch0034_00_matsurika/2301_1201_3500_10": "Aw, man... I think the paint got messed\nup, though. Granbull must have chewed\non it a little bit.",
    "charaepi_ch0034_00_matsurika/2301_0301_3600_10": "That means he must like it!",
    "charaepi_ch0034_00_matsurika/2301_0401_3700_10": "Well, I AM pretty proud of it!",
    "charaepi_ch0034_00_matsurika/2301_0401_3800_10": "You know, I don’t even really mind that\nit got ruined. It’s enough for me just\nknowing that Granbull loved it!",
    "charaepi_ch0034_00_matsurika/2301_0302_3900_10": "That’s a bummer.",
    "charaepi_ch0034_00_matsurika/2301_0402_4000_10": "Not necessarily...\nGranbull must have chomped onto this\npainting because he really liked it.",
    "charaepi_ch0034_00_matsurika/2301_0402_4100_10": "And if that’s the case, I don’t really mind\nthat it got ruined. ",
    "charaepi_ch0034_00_matsurika/2301_0402_4200_10": "It served its purpose!",
    "charaepi_ch0034_00_matsurika/2301_1201_4300_10": "I mean, look how happy Granbull looks!",
    "charaepi_ch0034_00_matsurika/2301_1201_4400_10": "I bet if you got close to him now, he wouldn’t\nbe afraid anymore, [Name:PlayerNickname ].",
    "charaepi_ch0034_00_matsurika/2301_1201_4500_10": "He may be a scaredy-cat, but he knows a nice\nperson when he sees one.",
