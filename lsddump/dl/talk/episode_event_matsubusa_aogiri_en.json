    "episode_event_matsubusa_aogiri/4009_1001_0200_10": "I wonder why they were so upset in the\nfirst place.",
    "episode_event_matsubusa_aogiri/4009_1001_0300_10": "This is just my own hypothesis...",
    "episode_event_matsubusa_aogiri/4009_1001_0400_10": "but perhaps these super-ancient Pokémon were\nsomehow influenced by us.",
    "episode_event_matsubusa_aogiri/4009_1001_0500_10": "Wait, are you sayin’ it’s my fault?",
    "episode_event_matsubusa_aogiri/4009_1001_0600_10": "Not just yours. I’d say the fault lies equally with\nus both.",
    "episode_event_matsubusa_aogiri/4009_1001_0700_10": "After all, we came here from another region,\ndidn’t we?",
    "episode_event_matsubusa_aogiri/4009_1001_0800_10": "And Groudon and Kyogre are also from\nthat region.",
    "episode_event_matsubusa_aogiri/4009_1001_0900_10": "They never existed on Pasio to begin with. Isn’t\nthat right?",
    "episode_event_matsubusa_aogiri/4009_1001_1000_10": "Yeah, because there aren’t any wild Pokémon on\nPasio in the first place.",
    "episode_event_matsubusa_aogiri/4009_1001_1100_10": "What’s your point?",
    "episode_event_matsubusa_aogiri/4009_1001_1200_10": "Are you sayin’ Groudon and Kyogre came here\nbecause of us?",
    "episode_event_matsubusa_aogiri/4009_1001_1300_10": "That doesn’t explain why they were rampaging!",
    "episode_event_matsubusa_aogiri/4009_1001_1400_10": "Um... I think maybe they just felt overwhelmed.",
    "episode_event_matsubusa_aogiri/4009_1001_1500_10": "If I were them, I’d be really scared to suddenly\nfind myself in a strange, new place, too.",
    "episode_event_matsubusa_aogiri/4009_1001_1600_10": "Hah! That’s pretty pathetic for a couple of\nsuper-ancient Legendary Pokémon!",
    "episode_event_matsubusa_aogiri/4009_1001_1700_10": "Well, this is all conjecture, of course.",
    "episode_event_matsubusa_aogiri/4009_1001_1800_10": "But if they were raging because of us...",
    "episode_event_matsubusa_aogiri/4009_1001_1900_10": "then we’ve gotta take responsibility for that,\ndon’t we?!",
    "episode_event_matsubusa_aogiri/4009_1001_2000_10": "I’m sorry, Kyogre!",
    "episode_event_matsubusa_aogiri/4009_1001_2100_10": "I get it! You were freakin’ out over bein’ in some\nnew place you didn’t recognize!",
    "episode_event_matsubusa_aogiri/4009_1001_2200_10": "But that battle we just had showed you that we\nmake a good team, right?",
    "episode_event_matsubusa_aogiri/4009_1001_2300_10": "Why don’t I take care of you until we can head\nback home?",
    "episode_event_matsubusa_aogiri/4009_1001_2400_10": "Wait, that means...",
    "episode_event_matsubusa_aogiri/4009_1001_2500_10": "Yeah, I’ll stop trying to sink Pasio into the ocean.",
    "episode_event_matsubusa_aogiri/4009_1001_2600_10": "Well...I can’t say this was part of the plan, but if\nyou find me worthy of being your partner, I won’t\nstop you from joining me.",
    "episode_event_matsubusa_aogiri/4009_1001_2700_10": "So...I guess that’s the end of that, then?",
    "episode_event_matsubusa_aogiri/4009_1001_2800_10": "Yup! Looks like it!",
    "episode_event_matsubusa_aogiri/4009_1001_2900_10": "I really hope so...",
    "episode_event_matsubusa_aogiri/4009_1001_3000_10": "You two better not do anything else extreme just\nto fulfill your ambitions, got it?!",
    "episode_event_matsubusa_aogiri/4009_0301_3100_10": "I’m so glad Pasio is safe!",
    "episode_event_matsubusa_aogiri/4009_0401_3200_10": "Me too! We should head back and let everyone\nknow it’s safe!",
    "episode_event_matsubusa_aogiri/4009_0302_3300_10": "Let’s report to Trista!",
    "episode_event_matsubusa_aogiri/4009_0402_3400_10": "Sounds like a plan! The sooner we let everyone\nknow they’re safe, the better!",
    "episode_event_matsubusa_aogiri/4010_1001_0100_10": "Oh, NOW you two show up?!",
    "episode_event_matsubusa_aogiri/4010_1001_0200_10": "Hmph. I can’t believe you came after the situation\nwas already resolved.",
    "episode_event_matsubusa_aogiri/4010_1001_0300_10": "How embarrassing...",
    "episode_event_matsubusa_aogiri/4010_1001_0400_10": "Now that the administrators of our respective \norganizations are here on Pasio, I suppose\nthat means...",
    "episode_event_matsubusa_aogiri/4010_1001_0500_10": "We can’t keep playin’ nice together on Pasio\nanymore, huh?",
    "episode_event_matsubusa_aogiri/4010_1001_0600_10": "Eh, that’s more our style anyway! Don’t you think\nso, too, Maxie-boy?",
    "episode_event_matsubusa_aogiri/4010_1001_0700_10": "Hmph. I hate to admit it, but I do agree.",
    "episode_event_matsubusa_aogiri/4010_1001_0800_10": "Even if it was just temporary, I suppose it wasn’t\nso bad teaming up with you.",
    "episode_event_matsubusa_aogiri/4010_1001_0900_10": "Hey, that’s my line!",
    "episode_event_matsubusa_aogiri/4010_1001_1000_10": "Whoa, hold your Horsea. No battlin’ without me\norderin’ it, all right?",
    "episode_event_matsubusa_aogiri/4010_1001_1100_10": "We can save it for next time! Now that your\ncrew’s all here, we can battle as much as\nwe want!",
    "episode_event_matsubusa_aogiri/4010_1001_1200_10": "Agreed. Let’s call a short truce...for now,\nat least.",
