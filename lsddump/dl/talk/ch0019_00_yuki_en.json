    "ch0019_00_yuki/0101_0701_01_10": "Oh, [Name:PlayerNickname ], I’ve been\nwaiting for you! Come on. Let’s get going!",
    "ch0019_00_yuki/0101_0701_02_10": "I think we’re gonna meet lots \nof different Pokémon today!",
    "ch0019_00_yuki/0601_0701_01_10": "The other day, I was wondering where my\nTreecko went. Turns out, he was clinging\nto the ceiling!",
    "ch0019_00_yuki/0601_0701_02_10": "I was looking at him, wondering what he was\nup to, when he suddenly came diving down\nonto my face.",
    "ch0019_00_yuki/0601_0701_03_10": "Seems like it’s his new hobby or something.\nHe surprised me, but I did get a good laugh, too!",
    "ch0019_00_yuki/0601_0702_01_10": "I told you about my Treecko and his new hobby\nof diving onto people’s faces, right?",
    "ch0019_00_yuki/0601_0702_02_10": "Well, we smacked heads when he tried that last\ntime. Ever since then he’s become a bit more\ncareful before he dives.",
    "ch0019_00_yuki/0601_0702_03_10": "It’s really funny watching Treecko carefully\nline up his jump!",
    "ch0019_00_yuki/0602_0701_01_10": "When I was back in the Hoenn region, my Taillow\nwould curl up on my head whenever it got cold.",
    "ch0019_00_yuki/0602_0701_02_10": "I think it liked it there ’cause my head is warm.\nIt was pretty much Taillow’s special spot.",
    "ch0019_00_yuki/0602_0701_03_10": "I don’t mind it when it’s windy, since it keeps\nmy hat from blowing away, but...",
    "ch0019_00_yuki/0602_0701_04_10": "I have to admit, Taillow gets a bit heavy when\nit sits on my head for too long.",
    "ch0019_00_yuki/0602_0702_01_10": "I get worried sometimes that Taillow might just\ngo ahead and turn my hat into a full nest.",
    "ch0019_00_yuki/0602_0702_02_10": "In the spring, it even catches the Worm Pokémon\nWurmple and leaves them on my hat!",
    "ch0019_00_yuki/0602_0702_03_10": "Maybe it’s too late about the nest thing, huh?",
    "ch0019_00_yuki/0603_0701_01_10": "My dad is actually a pretty amazing\nGym Leader.",
    "ch0019_00_yuki/0603_0701_02_10": "And my dream is to become a better Pokémon\nTrainer than my dad!",
    "ch0019_00_yuki/0603_0701_03_10": "So I want to learn even more about Pokémon\nand become stronger than I am now.",
    "ch0019_00_yuki/0603_0702_01_10": "Someday, I’d love to become a Gym Leader\nwith my favorite Pokémon.",
    "ch0019_00_yuki/0603_0702_02_10": "And be an obstacle for Trainers to overcome,\njust like my dad.",
    "ch0019_00_yuki/0603_0702_03_10": "In order for my dream to come true, I’d better\nbe able to win in the PML, at least!",
    "ch0019_00_yuki/0604_0701_01_10": "You know, I have a friend named May.\nShe’s my best rival!",
    "ch0019_00_yuki/0604_0701_02_10": "I still remember the first time we had\na Pokémon battle, back in the Hoenn region.",
    "ch0019_00_yuki/0604_0701_03_10": "I’d never had a heated Pokémon battle like that,\nwhere we both give it everything we have!",
    "ch0019_00_yuki/0604_0702_01_10": "May’s always cheerful and energetic, but when\nshe watches stars at night, she gets really quiet.",
    "ch0019_00_yuki/0604_0702_02_10": "We were watching shooting stars the other day,\nand every time she saw one, her eyes lit up.",
    "ch0019_00_yuki/0604_0702_03_10": "Her eyes were really pretty, too, like stars!",
    "ch0019_00_yuki/0605_0701_01_10": "You need a rival for a journey, right?\nLike, a friend who helps you keep going \nand challenges you to become stronger!",
    "ch0019_00_yuki/0605_0701_02_10": "Yeah, I’ve got May, but it’s not like we’re\nalways together here.",
    "ch0019_00_yuki/0605_0701_03_10": "Besides, I can never have too many rivals.",
    "ch0019_00_yuki/0605_0701_04_10": "Now, I’d really like my rivals to be strong\nand dependable—like a partner almost, right?",
    "ch0019_00_yuki/0605_0701_05_10": "You wouldn’t happen to know anyone like that,\nwould you, [Name:PlayerNickname ]?",
    "ch0019_00_yuki/0605_0702_01_10": "In case it wasn’t clear, I was thinking about you\nwhen I was talking about all that rival stuff, OK?",
    "ch0019_00_yuki/0605_0702_02_10": "I might as well be direct.\nYou’re definitely one of my rivals now, OK?\n[Name:PlayerNickname ]!",
    "ch0019_00_yuki/1701_0701_01_10": "Oh, I was just looking for you!",
    "ch0019_00_yuki/1701_0701_02_10": "You can have this.\nMy Pokémon found it stuck in a tree.",
    "ch0019_00_yuki/1701_0702_01_10": "It was a pretty good item, right?",
    "ch0019_00_yuki/1701_0702_02_10": "I personally like it a lot, so I hope it comes in\nhandy for you, too!",
    "ch0019_00_yuki/2501_0701_01_10": "Do you remember what inspired you to become\na Pokémon Trainer?",
    "ch0019_00_yuki/2501_0701_02_10": "For me, it was my dad. I always wanted to be\nan amazing Trainer like him.",
    "ch0019_00_yuki/2501_0701_03_10": "I’ve become stronger so that I could catch up\nto him.",
    "ch0019_00_yuki/2501_0702_01_10": "My dad’s a Gym Leader, and I’ve battled\nhim before. I won that time.",
    "ch0019_00_yuki/2501_0702_02_10": "I might have defeated him when he battled me\nas a Gym Leader, but...",
    "ch0019_00_yuki/2501_0702_03_10": "I still don’t feel like I’ve really surpassed him yet.\nHe has more knowledge, more experience,\nmore everything.",
    "ch0019_00_yuki/2501_0702_04_10": "So someday, I want to become the better\nPokémon Trainer, in every way!",
    "ch0019_00_yuki/2501_0702_05_10": "That’s why I have Pokémon battles every day!\nI want to really get to know all the Pokémon,\njust like my dad!",
    "ch0019_00_yuki/2511_0701_01_10": "As I’ve watched you get stronger, I’ve started\nfeeling something. I think it’s anxiousness?",
    "ch0019_00_yuki/2511_0701_02_10": "Until now, all I really thought about was\novertaking my dad. But now, you’re on my mind.",
    "ch0019_00_yuki/2511_0701_03_10": "I don’t want you to leave me behind—or even\ncatch up to me! That’s what helps me become\neven stronger.",
    "ch0019_00_yuki/2511_0701_04_10": "I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again:\nyou’re definitely my rival!",
    "ch0019_00_yuki/2511_0702_01_10": "I’m glad you’re my rival, you know.\nIt’s helped me become even stronger!",
    "ch0019_00_yuki/2511_0702_02_10": "I guess this is what you call a healthy rivalry.",
    "ch0019_00_yuki/2511_0702_03_10": "Finding a worthy opponent, and competing with\nthem as rivals...",
    "ch0019_00_yuki/2511_0702_04_10": "Don’t you think it’s a good way to be?\nYou’d better stay sharp. You’re one of my\nbest rivals now!",
    "ch0019_00_yuki/3001_0701_01_10": "Great weather this morning!\nGood thing we got up early!",
    "ch0019_00_yuki/3002_0701_01_10": "Hey!\nI woke up to the sounds of chirping Pokémon.\nAnyways, I’ll be counting on you today!",
    "ch0019_00_yuki/3003_0701_01_10": "It’s afternoon already?\nThe perfect time for Pokémon battles!",
    "ch0019_00_yuki/3004_0701_01_10": "There’s a lot of stuff on sale here,\nso you can always find something new.",
    "ch0019_00_yuki/3005_0701_01_10": "I want to know more about Pokémon you\ncan only find at night!",
    "ch0019_00_yuki/3006_0701_01_10": "Wow, the stars are beautiful tonight.\nMaybe we’ll see a shooting star!",
