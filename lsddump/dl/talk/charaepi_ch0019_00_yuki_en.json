    "charaepi_ch0019_00_yuki/2301_1201_0300_10": "Oh, there you are, Treecko.",
    "charaepi_ch0019_00_yuki/2301_1201_0400_10": "Wait... [Name:PlayerNickname ]?!\nWhat are you doing here?!",
    "charaepi_ch0019_00_yuki/2301_1201_0500_10": "Sorry I startled you.\nTreecko looked like he was itching for a fight.",
    "charaepi_ch0019_00_yuki/2301_0301_0600_10": "No, it’s fine!",
    "charaepi_ch0019_00_yuki/2301_0401_0700_10": "Man, Trainers aiming for the top \nhave some guts, don’t they?",
    "charaepi_ch0019_00_yuki/2301_0302_0800_10": "I felt my heart skip a beat!",
    "charaepi_ch0019_00_yuki/2301_0402_0900_10": "Sorry, sorry!\nBut in my defense, you did let your guard down.",
    "charaepi_ch0019_00_yuki/2301_1201_1000_10": "Treecko and I were just in the middle of trying\nto figure out some new tactics.",
    "charaepi_ch0019_00_yuki/2301_1201_1100_10": "Treecko can climb trees and walls using the\nsmall hooks on his hands and feet.",

    "charaepi_ch0019_00_yuki/2301_1201_1500_10": "It’s a little awkward going up against your own\nfamily, isn’t it?",
    "charaepi_ch0019_00_yuki/2301_1201_1600_10": "I mean, it clearly shows you who’s\nstronger, right?",
    "charaepi_ch0019_00_yuki/2301_1201_1700_10": "And it doesn’t matter whether you win or lose.\nIt will still become awkward. I mean...what do\nyou talk about after that?",
    "charaepi_ch0019_00_yuki/2301_1201_1800_10": "But that wasn’t the case for my dad. He lost to\nme, but he seemed a little happy.",

    "charaepi_ch0019_00_yuki/2301_0301_2000_10": "Then don’t battle.",
    "charaepi_ch0019_00_yuki/2301_0401_2100_10": "But I have to!",
    "charaepi_ch0019_00_yuki/2301_0302_2200_10": "Why don’t you run away?",
    "charaepi_ch0019_00_yuki/2301_0402_2300_10": "I can’t do that!",
    "charaepi_ch0019_00_yuki/2301_1201_2400_10": "I get to have a strong rival really close by!\nHow could I not battle him?!",
    "charaepi_ch0019_00_yuki/2301_1201_2500_10": "Besides, I can’t say that I’m stronger than him\njust because I beat him once.",
    "charaepi_ch0019_00_yuki/2301_1201_2600_10": "Maybe if my dad and I had different specialties,\nlike the neighbors do, I wouldn’t be so bothered.",

    "charaepi_ch0019_00_yuki/2301_0302_2900_10": "Specialties?",
    "charaepi_ch0019_00_yuki/2301_0402_3000_10": "Yeah, like Professor Birch and May have.\nThey’re my next-door neighbors.",
    "charaepi_ch0019_00_yuki/2301_1201_3100_10": "Professor Birch focuses on his fieldwork,\nand May focuses on her contests.\nSee? No overlap.",
    "charaepi_ch0019_00_yuki/2301_1201_3200_10": "But thinking like that is just me running away.\nWhile clashing can be tough, it might actually\nbe fortunate at the same time.",
    "charaepi_ch0019_00_yuki/2301_1201_3300_10": "My dad is strong and respectable.\nThat’s why I want to overcome him.",
    "charaepi_ch0019_00_yuki/2301_1201_3400_10": "And that’s why I have to get even better at\nmy specialty!",
    "charaepi_ch0019_00_yuki/2301_1201_3500_10": "Come on, Treecko!\nBullet Seed!",
    "charaepi_ch0019_00_yuki/2301_1201_3600_10": "Hey, [Name:PlayerNickname ].\nLet’s have a battle sometime!",
    "charaepi_ch0019_00_yuki/2301_1201_3700_10": "That way I can see how much stronger I’ve gotten!",
    "charaepi_ch0019_00_yuki/2311_1201_0100_10": "Well, if it isn’t Brendan!\nI heard your tail is on fire right now!",
    "charaepi_ch0019_00_yuki/2311_1201_0200_10": "Oh hi, Noland! What’s a Frontier Brain doing here?\nWait, did you just call me a Charmander?",
    "charaepi_ch0019_00_yuki/2311_1201_0300_10": "You know what I mean. But how about it?\nYou want me to test how strong you’ve gotten?",
    "charaepi_ch0019_00_yuki/2311_1201_0400_10": "Uh, I’m not sure I do, but if it’s a \nPokémon battle you want, you got it!",
    "charaepi_ch0019_00_yuki/2311_0101_0100_10": "All right, then! Let’s see what you got.",
    "charaepi_ch0019_00_yuki/2311_0101_0200_10": "You’d better not disappoint me!",
    "charaepi_ch0019_00_yuki/2311_0501_0100_10": "Yeah! You get it, don’t you?\nI learned a lot from that battle!",
    "charaepi_ch0019_00_yuki/2311_0501_0200_10": "Wait, doesn’t it bother you that you lost?",
    "charaepi_ch0019_00_yuki/2311_0501_0300_10": "Of course it bothers me!\nBut I’m more happy than frustrated!\nThis defeat is great experience!",
    "charaepi_ch0019_00_yuki/2311_0501_0400_10": "I gotta go home and reflect on this \nbefore I forget anything!",
    "charaepi_ch0019_00_yuki/2311_0501_0500_10": "Man, that is one busy guy...\nHey! If you ever need somebody to battle again,\nlet me know!",
    "charaepi_ch0019_00_yuki/2311_0501_0600_10": "Wha...Treecko?\nOh, you must have leveled up with that last battle!",
    "charaepi_ch0019_00_yuki/2311_0501_0700_10": "I’m so excited to see you evolve, Treecko!\nWe’re gonna have even more fun together now!",
    "charaepi_ch0019_00_yuki/2312_1201_0100_10": "Look at you, Brendan!\nYou and Grovyle have grown so much!",
    "charaepi_ch0019_00_yuki/2312_1201_0200_10": "How about it? You want to have a battle?\nI want to see if you’ve gotten any stronger.",
    "charaepi_ch0019_00_yuki/2312_1201_0300_10": "You bet, Dad!",
    "charaepi_ch0019_00_yuki/2312_1201_0400_10": "Come on!\nLet’s show him what we can do, Grovyle!",
    "charaepi_ch0019_00_yuki/2312_0101_0100_10": "You don’t know how happy it makes me that\nI get to battle you like this, son!",
    "charaepi_ch0019_00_yuki/2312_0101_0200_10": "I’m going all out on this, so you’d better\nnot hold anything back either!",
    "charaepi_ch0019_00_yuki/2312_0501_0100_10": "I gave it everything I had.\nThere’s nothing to regret!\nThat was a great battle, Brendan!",
    "charaepi_ch0019_00_yuki/2312_0501_0200_10": "You’ve really gotten strong, haven’t you?\nI feel like I need to go into the mountains and\ntrain some more.",
    "charaepi_ch0019_00_yuki/2312_0501_0300_10": "All right, Dad. Just don’t overdo it, OK? \nOr else you’ll have to answer to Mom again.",
    "charaepi_ch0019_00_yuki/2312_0501_0400_10": "Huh? Grovyle... Are you evolving?!",
    "charaepi_ch0019_00_yuki/2312_0501_0500_10": "If you become any stronger and cooler, I don’t\nthink anyone will have a chance against us!",
