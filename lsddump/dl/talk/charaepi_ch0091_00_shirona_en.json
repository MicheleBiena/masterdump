    "charaepi_ch0091_00_shirona/2301_0401_0500_10": "When you give your Pokémon a command, pour as\nmuch emotion into it as you can. Pokémon respond\nto feelings much more than words alone.",

    "charaepi_ch0091_00_shirona/2301_0302_1400_10": "What sort of documents?",
    "charaepi_ch0091_00_shirona/2301_0402_1500_10": "Mostly academic. As you know, I’m a Pokémon\nTrainer, but I’m also an archeologist.\nIt’s a very busy job.",

    "charaepi_ch0091_00_shirona/2301_0401_2100_10": "And I use them all the time, so they need to be\nplaced somewhere I can reach them easily, right?",
    "charaepi_ch0091_00_shirona/2301_0302_2200_10": "You can do it!",
    "charaepi_ch0091_00_shirona/2301_0402_2300_10": "You’re right... I can!",
    "charaepi_ch0091_00_shirona/2301_0402_2400_10": "Cleaning is something you should put all your\neffort into, and make sure you get it all done\nat once.",
    "charaepi_ch0091_00_shirona/2301_0402_2500_10": "Otherwise, you’ll end up doing the same thing,\nday after day.",

    "charaepi_ch0091_00_shirona/2301_1201_3000_10": "Likewise, when I was staying at my friend\nCaitlin’s villa...",
    "charaepi_ch0091_00_shirona/2301_1201_3100_10": "it didn’t take long for my room there to become a\nmess of scattered research papers.",

    "charaepi_ch0091_00_shirona/2301_1201_3700_10": "When it comes to Pokémon battling, I know exactly\nwhat I have to do.",
    "charaepi_ch0091_00_shirona/2301_1201_3800_10": "But cleaning? I barely even know where to start,\nlet alone what works best.",
