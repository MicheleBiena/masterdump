    "charaepi_ch0020_00_toya/2301_1201_1000_10": "If that’s true, there must be a lot of Trainers out\nthere looking for their Pokémon right now.",

    "charaepi_ch0020_00_toya/2301_0402_1500_10": "Whoa, Oshawott! Calm down!\nSorry, I guess he wants you to help us out.",
    "charaepi_ch0020_00_toya/2301_0402_1600_10": "You’ll help me? Really?\nThanks so much! I really appreciate it!",

    "charaepi_ch0020_00_toya/2301_1201_1900_10": "I can’t thank you enough! We were able to get\nall those Pokémon back to their Trainers,\nthanks to you!",
    "charaepi_ch0020_00_toya/2301_1201_2000_10": "But I wonder why they got separated to\nbegin with? They all mentioned seeing\nsome suspicious Trainers going around.",
    "charaepi_ch0020_00_toya/2301_0301_2100_10": "It might be those knuckleheads with\nthe masks.",
    "charaepi_ch0020_00_toya/2301_0401_2200_10": "Oh, you may be right.\nI didn’t think of that possibility.",
    "charaepi_ch0020_00_toya/2301_0302_2300_10": "Maybe there are bad Trainers about?",

    "charaepi_ch0020_00_toya/2301_1201_2500_10": "If that’s the case, maybe it was for the best that\nthose Pokémon gathered around me.",

    "charaepi_ch0020_00_toya/2301_1201_3000_10": "I think he wants to be like my Samurott.\nI can’t blame him. Samurott is really strong.",

    "charaepi_ch0020_00_toya/2301_1201_3300_10": "Trainers and Pokémon don’t really do well on their\nown, do they?",
    "charaepi_ch0020_00_toya/2301_1201_3400_10": "Ah, sorry. Guess I’m just starting to ramble now.",
    "charaepi_ch0020_00_toya/2301_1201_3500_10": "You’re such a good listener that I got\ncarried away.",
    "charaepi_ch0020_00_toya/2301_1201_3600_10": "That reminds me. You want to be stronger, right?",
    "charaepi_ch0020_00_toya/2301_0301_3700_10": "Yup!",
    "charaepi_ch0020_00_toya/2301_0401_3800_10": "Then it might be a good thing \nthat we teamed up!",
    "charaepi_ch0020_00_toya/2301_0302_3900_10": "No no, not stronger. Strongest!",
    "charaepi_ch0020_00_toya/2301_0402_4000_10": "Then it might be a good thing \nthat we teamed up!",
    "charaepi_ch0020_00_toya/2301_1201_4100_10": "I think we’re on the same wavelength!",
    "charaepi_ch0020_00_toya/2301_1201_4200_10": "I’m sure we’ll be tagging along at least until\nOshawott reaches his full potential.",
    "charaepi_ch0020_00_toya/2301_1201_4300_10": "I’m with you not only as your teammate\nbut also as a friend and rival!",
    "charaepi_ch0020_00_toya/2301_1201_4400_10": "So here’s to us!",
    "charaepi_ch0020_00_toya/2311_1201_0100_10": "Hey, Hilbert! How’s your exploration of\nPasio going?",
    "charaepi_ch0020_00_toya/2311_1201_0200_10": "Well, we’ve been all over, and the highlight has\nbeen getting to battle all kinds of sync pairs.",
    "charaepi_ch0020_00_toya/2311_1201_0300_10": "Oh, if that’s the case, then you should battle me!\nI’ll check just how strong you really are.",
    "charaepi_ch0020_00_toya/2311_1201_0400_10": "All right then, Brendan! Let’s battle!",
    "charaepi_ch0020_00_toya/2311_0101_0100_10": "You think you can handle my Grovyle?!",
    "charaepi_ch0020_00_toya/2311_0101_0200_10": "Make one mistake against us, and it’ll be all over\nfor you!",
    "charaepi_ch0020_00_toya/2311_0501_0100_10": "Ouch! I had no idea anybody could battle like that.",
    "charaepi_ch0020_00_toya/2311_0501_0200_10": "I thought I was in trouble there. If it hadn’t been\nfor Oshawott’s quick thinking, you’d have had us.",
    "charaepi_ch0020_00_toya/2311_0501_0300_10": "Sounds like your Pokémon’s getting stronger, too,\nhuh? We’ve gotta make sure we as Trainers can\nkeep up with them!",
    "charaepi_ch0020_00_toya/2311_0501_0400_10": "O-Oshawott?! Is this what they call Evolution?",
    "charaepi_ch0020_00_toya/2311_0501_0500_10": "I was pretty surprised in that last battle, too!\nI didn’t realize how strong we had gotten!",
    "charaepi_ch0020_00_toya/2312_1201_0100_10": "Hey, Hilbert. I’ve been hearing a lot about how\nwell you’ve been doing here.",
    "charaepi_ch0020_00_toya/2312_1201_0200_10": "Thanks! My Dewott’s at peak performance right\nnow! Something tells me it might be about time\nfor Evolution...",
    "charaepi_ch0020_00_toya/2312_1201_0300_10": "Well, in that case, I would definitely like to battle\nyou. What do you say?",
    "charaepi_ch0020_00_toya/2312_1201_0400_10": "You got it! I’m always ready for an intense\nPokémon battle!",
    "charaepi_ch0020_00_toya/2312_0101_0100_10": "All right—it’s time to reach new heights in battle!",
    "charaepi_ch0020_00_toya/2312_0101_0200_10": "I’m sure you can become even stronger than\nyou already are!",
    "charaepi_ch0020_00_toya/2312_0501_0100_10": "You got me... You certainly are strong! \nI even felt that it might be time for Evolution.",
    "charaepi_ch0020_00_toya/2312_0501_0200_10": "Thanks, Cheren! You came along just to help us\nwith our Evolution, huh?",
    "charaepi_ch0020_00_toya/2312_0501_0300_10": "Perhaps I did. It was not my intention to\nlose, though.",
    "charaepi_ch0020_00_toya/2312_0501_0400_10": "Dewott! You really are evolving!",
    "charaepi_ch0020_00_toya/2312_0501_0500_10": "Ooh, I can’t wait to see what you look like once\nyou’ve evolved!",
