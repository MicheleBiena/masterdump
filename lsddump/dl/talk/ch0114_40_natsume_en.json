    "ch0114_40_natsume/7101_0701_02_10": "If you get something you want without working for\nit, how can you find the motivation to make your\ndreams come true by yourself?",

    "ch0114_40_natsume/7102_0701_02_10": "With a fresh outlook, I’m sure we could take on\nany challenge.",
    "ch0114_40_natsume/7103_0701_01_10": "This outfit might look like it’s hard to move around\nin. Far from it. Now that I’m used to it, it feels as\nlight as a breeze.",
    "ch0114_40_natsume/7103_0701_02_10": "What’s more, wearing it makes me feel pure of\nheart and mind and ready for anything.",
    "ch0114_40_natsume/7104_0701_01_10": "It’s strange, but something mysterious has been\nhappening ever since I put on this outfit...",
    "ch0114_40_natsume/7104_0701_02_10": "I can see premonitions much more clearly—both\ngood and bad.",

    "ch0114_40_natsume/2501_0702_01_10": "The ringing sound Chingling makes is beautiful,\nbut that’s not all...",
    "ch0114_40_natsume/2501_0702_02_10": "She uses it to deafen her foes by emitting\nhigh-frequency cries.",
    "ch0114_40_natsume/2501_0702_03_10": "By doing that, she disrupts the communication\nbetween the Pokémon that we face and their\nTrainers. It’s a deceptively powerful ability.",
    "ch0114_40_natsume/2511_0701_01_10": "Chingling and I have resolved to become the\nbest sync pair on Pasio.",
    "ch0114_40_natsume/2511_0701_02_10": "But I suppose you probably made the exact\nsame resolution...",
    "ch0114_40_natsume/2511_0701_03_10": "Oh dear. You don’t look like you’re going to give\nup so easily. What to do?",
    "ch0114_40_natsume/2511_0702_01_10": "Maybe it’s because of this outfit and the clear\nsound of Chingling’s bell, but my psychic abilities\nare at their peak.",
    "ch0114_40_natsume/2511_0702_02_10": "I feel like I can’t lose. Let’s go out and\nwin together.",
