    "episode_event_rivalmeeting01/4005_1001_1500_10": "That’s why I’m gonna work hard with my\nteammates and win this tournament!",

    "episode_event_rivalmeeting01/4006_1001_0100_10": "I see. So that’s what happened, huh.",
    "episode_event_rivalmeeting01/4006_1001_0200_10": "I’ve never met anyone with such a stuck-up\npersonality in my life.",
    "episode_event_rivalmeeting01/4006_1001_0300_10": "I guess that’s why you two don’t mesh. You’ve\nalways disliked anything that goes against\nyour values.",

    "episode_event_rivalmeeting01/4007_1001_1200_10": "I refuse to continue losing in such a\ndisgraceful manner.",
    "episode_event_rivalmeeting01/4007_1001_1300_10": "Well...when you need a hand, I’ll cover you.",

    "episode_event_rivalmeeting01/4007_1001_1500_10": "I’ll hold you to that. Don’t even think about\nslowing us down.",

    "episode_event_rivalmeeting01/4008_1001_1400_10": "Yeah! I won’t just stand by and let you do that,\nTeam Break!",
    "episode_event_rivalmeeting01/4008_1001_1600_10": "Heh. It’s about time you all got on the same page.",
    "episode_event_rivalmeeting01/4008_1001_1700_10": "I guess joining the tournament really did teach you\na thing or two.",

    "episode_event_rivalmeeting01/4008_1001_1900_10": "But this has nothing to do with the tournament.",
