    "ch0092_80_iris/7101_0701_01_10": "Some people think Hydreigon is kind of scary\nbecause it’s known as a Brutal Pokémon.",
    "ch0092_80_iris/7101_0701_02_10": "But when I pet my Hydreigon on the head, she\ncloses her eyes and looks really happy!",
    "ch0092_80_iris/7101_0701_03_10": "Do you wanna try petting her, too?",
    "ch0092_80_iris/7102_0701_01_10": "Battles are so interesting. The more you battle, the\nstronger you get—and the better you understand\nyour opponent!",
    "ch0092_80_iris/7102_0701_02_10": "Thanks to battles, I’ve been able to make a lot of\nnew friends!",

    "ch0092_80_iris/7104_0701_01_10": "There are a lot of really pretty and fashionable\npeople here on Pasio.",
    "ch0092_80_iris/7104_0701_02_10": "I gotta do better and show off my creative\nside, too!",

    "ch0092_80_iris/2501_0702_01_10": "Of course if you like someone, you’ll wanna be by\ntheir side!",
