    "charaepi_ch0091_01_shirona/2301_1201_0400_10": "Very well. Then let the battle...",

    "charaepi_ch0091_01_shirona/2301_0401_1000_10": "Did you hear that, Kommo-o? What a compliment!\nAnd from [Name:PlayerNickname ], no less.",

    "charaepi_ch0091_01_shirona/2301_1201_1500_10": "I bring Kommo-o and Garchomp here often\nso they can do some sparring and compare\ntheir strength.",
    "charaepi_ch0091_01_shirona/2301_1201_1600_10": "Actually, since you’re here, I ought to give you\ntwo a proper introduction!",
    "charaepi_ch0091_01_shirona/2301_1201_1700_10": "This is Kommo-o. He and I partner up when I\nchange into this sygna suit.",
    "charaepi_ch0091_01_shirona/2301_1201_1800_10": "I raised him from an Egg I received in Alola.",
    "charaepi_ch0091_01_shirona/2301_0301_1900_10": "From an Egg?!",
    "charaepi_ch0091_01_shirona/2301_0401_2000_10": "That’s right! He’s come a long way. He hatched\nfrom that Egg as a little Jangmo-o, and now two\nevolutions later, just look at him!",
    "charaepi_ch0091_01_shirona/2301_0302_2100_10": "Was it tough raising him?",
    "charaepi_ch0091_01_shirona/2301_0402_2200_10": "Not in the slightest.",
    "charaepi_ch0091_01_shirona/2301_0402_2300_10": "It’s been such a joy to watch him grow into the\nPokémon he is today.",
    "charaepi_ch0091_01_shirona/2301_1201_2400_10": "It’s hard to believe you were once that little\nJangmo-o that used to struggle in our training\nsessions. You’ve come a long way since then!",
    "charaepi_ch0091_01_shirona/2301_1201_2500_10": "He’s been competing with Garchomp from the\nmoment he hatched.",
    "charaepi_ch0091_01_shirona/2301_1201_2600_10": "Their rivalry ran as deep as their bond. Not a day\nwent by without him challenging Garchomp to\na battle.",
    "charaepi_ch0091_01_shirona/2301_1201_2700_10": "And if I remember right, he would lose every time.",
    "charaepi_ch0091_01_shirona/2301_1201_2800_10": "Sounds like Kommo-o wants me to stop dredging\nup the past. Hehe! Such a sore loser, this one.",
    "charaepi_ch0091_01_shirona/2301_1201_2900_10": "Once he evolved into Kommo-o, though, \nthat’s when he really began to hold his own\nagainst Garchomp.",
    "charaepi_ch0091_01_shirona/2301_1201_3000_10": "Then one day, the sygna suit designer saw\nKommo-o and offered to make an outfit for me\nto wear with him.",
    "charaepi_ch0091_01_shirona/2301_1201_3100_10": "From that moment, I decided I would take on the\nPML wearing this sygna suit, with Kommo-o at\nmy side.",
    "charaepi_ch0091_01_shirona/2301_0301_3200_10": "You’ve put a lot of trust in Kommo-o!",
    "charaepi_ch0091_01_shirona/2301_0401_3300_10": "He’s earned it! He’s the gutsiest Pokémon I know.",
    "charaepi_ch0091_01_shirona/2301_0302_3400_10": "And a new sync pair was born!",
    "charaepi_ch0091_01_shirona/2301_0402_3500_10": "Yes, indeed. I want to take on new challenges\nwith him as my partner, and I have no doubt that\nhe’ll live up to my expectations.",
    "charaepi_ch0091_01_shirona/2301_1201_3600_10": "But when I decided to partner up with Kommo-o,\none thought did cross my mind...",
    "charaepi_ch0091_01_shirona/2301_1201_3700_10": "Namely, what about Garchomp?",
    "charaepi_ch0091_01_shirona/2301_1201_3800_10": "On Pasio, the Pokémon that inspires a Trainer’s\nsygna suit is meant to be their ace. Losing a battle\nwhile wearing a sygna suit is unacceptable.",
    "charaepi_ch0091_01_shirona/2301_1201_3900_10": "And for me, a Pokémon League Champion, that’s\nespecially true. So why did I not choose Garchomp\nwhen she’s fought by my side for so long?",
    "charaepi_ch0091_01_shirona/2301_1201_4000_10": "In the end, Kommo-o’s example is what made me\nchange my mind.",
    "charaepi_ch0091_01_shirona/2301_1201_4100_10": "As a Champion, I have a reputation to maintain.\nBut if I played it safe just to defend my reputation,\nI’d be depriving myself of so many possibilities.",
    "charaepi_ch0091_01_shirona/2301_1201_4200_10": "If I stopped taking risks because I was afraid of\nlosing face, what example would I be setting for\nother Trainers?",
    "charaepi_ch0091_01_shirona/2301_1201_4300_10": "Certainly not one that befits a Champion!",
    "charaepi_ch0091_01_shirona/2301_1201_4400_10": "A good Champion is prepared to face any and all\nchallenges without fear of defeat!",
    "charaepi_ch0091_01_shirona/2301_1201_4500_10": "Like a little Jangmo-o challenging a full-grown\nGarchomp to battle every day!",
    "charaepi_ch0091_01_shirona/2301_1201_4600_10": "Hehe. Sorry, I got a little too passionate just now.",
    "charaepi_ch0091_01_shirona/2301_0301_4700_10": "You two are a great match!",
    "charaepi_ch0091_01_shirona/2301_0401_4800_10": "My thoughts exactly. Seeing how far he has come\ninspires me to do the same.",
    "charaepi_ch0091_01_shirona/2301_0302_4900_10": "You have to work hard for\nGarchomp’s sake, too!",
    "charaepi_ch0091_01_shirona/2301_0402_5000_10": "You’re right! Garchomp won’t accept anything\nless than my best.",
    "charaepi_ch0091_01_shirona/2301_1201_5100_10": "Yes, you’re right, Kommo-o.",
    "charaepi_ch0091_01_shirona/2301_1201_5200_10": "I guess we should wrap this up. Kommo-o sounds\neager to face some new opponents! Maybe this\nconversation lit a fire in him, too.",
    "charaepi_ch0091_01_shirona/2301_1201_5300_10": "And I’m not the type of Champion who’s content\nto rest on my laurels, either.",
    "charaepi_ch0091_01_shirona/2301_1201_5400_10": "Kommo-o and I, we’re going to keep charging\nahead down the road of possibility!",
