    "ch0029_00_asuna/0101_0701_02_10": "You know I’m all warmed up—touch me and\nyou might get burned! Well, let’s head out!",
    "ch0029_00_asuna/0601_0701_01_10": "In my hometown of Lavaridge, you can walk\nright out the back of the Pokémon Center and\ninto a hot spring!",
    "ch0029_00_asuna/0601_0701_02_10": "You can feel the heat of the earth in the water.",
    "ch0029_00_asuna/0601_0701_03_10": "It makes me so hot, I feel like my whole body\nis made of flames!",
    "ch0029_00_asuna/0601_0701_04_10": "I’d love to go on a nice trip to some hot\nsprings with my Pokémon.",
    "ch0029_00_asuna/0601_0702_01_10": "Hot springs are good for Pokémon, too!\nI always bring along some Pokémon\nwhen I go for a soak.",
    "ch0029_00_asuna/0601_0702_02_10": "My Numel feels refreshed after a soak\nin the springs, too!",

    "ch0029_00_asuna/0602_0701_02_10": "And that’s when you’ve just gotta do it!",
    "ch0029_00_asuna/0602_0701_03_10": "Times like those are when it’s most\nimportant to just go for it!",
    "ch0029_00_asuna/0602_0701_04_10": "Weak flames will get blown out easily.\nYou gotta go big when you light your fire!",
    "ch0029_00_asuna/0602_0702_01_10": "When you don’t feel like you can keep going...",
    "ch0029_00_asuna/0602_0702_02_10": "come see me! I’ll light your fire\nback up again!",
    "ch0029_00_asuna/0603_0701_01_10": "Some Fire-type Pokémon are so hot,\nit’s tough to pet them.",
    "ch0029_00_asuna/0603_0701_02_10": "Slugma’s body and Torkoal’s shell\nget amazingly hot!",
    "ch0029_00_asuna/0603_0701_03_10": "Be careful not to burn yourself!",
    "ch0029_00_asuna/0603_0702_01_10": "Pokémon like it when you show them affection.",
    "ch0029_00_asuna/0603_0702_02_10": "Even if they’re hot, when you give them just a\nlittle pat, they’ll know how much you care.",
    "ch0029_00_asuna/0604_0701_01_10": "Torkoal and I’ve been together for a long time.",
    "ch0029_00_asuna/0604_0701_02_10": "When you’ve been around somebody since you\nwere a kid, they feel like family, don’t they?",
    "ch0029_00_asuna/0604_0701_03_10": "Torkoal’s always been there to cheer me up\nwhenever I was feeling down.",
    "ch0029_00_asuna/0604_0701_04_10": "I want to show Torkoal how thankful I am,\nand that’s why I’m so fired up to be the\nbest Trainer I can be!",
    "ch0029_00_asuna/0604_0702_01_10": "Torkoal’s shell is very important to her.",
    "ch0029_00_asuna/0604_0702_02_10": "Even when her shell gets hot, I try to polish it.",
    "ch0029_00_asuna/0604_0702_03_10": "When I do, Torkoal gets really happy!",
    "ch0029_00_asuna/0605_0701_01_10": "Do you like hot springs? You should try stopping\nby one when you head out on an adventure!",
    "ch0029_00_asuna/0605_0701_02_10": "There are all kinds of different hot springs,\nand they can be really good for you.\nIt’s fun to travel around to different ones, too!",
    "ch0029_00_asuna/0605_0701_03_10": "Some hot springs let you bring your Pokémon\nalong, too. I bet your Pokémon would like it.",
    "ch0029_00_asuna/0605_0702_01_10": "Battling can be awfully tiring, so it’s important\nto rest up and refresh, too.",
    "ch0029_00_asuna/0605_0702_02_10": "You might have some way of resting that works\neven better than a soak in a hot spring for you.",
    "ch0029_00_asuna/1701_0701_01_10": "Thanks for everything! This is all yours!",
    "ch0029_00_asuna/1701_0701_02_10": "I might forget I have it on me and carry it right\ninto the hot springs anyway. Then it’d be no\ngood to anybody!",
    "ch0029_00_asuna/1701_0702_01_10": "You get all embarrassed when\nyou get a present, don’t you.",
    "ch0029_00_asuna/1701_0702_02_10": "But I’m going to bring you another one\nwhen I find something good!",
    "ch0029_00_asuna/2501_0701_01_10": "Try not to push yourself too hard.",
    "ch0029_00_asuna/2501_0701_02_10": "I was trying too hard to be a good Gym Leader\nand ended up falling into a slump.",
    "ch0029_00_asuna/2501_0701_03_10": "That’s when I realized that if I just relax and\ndo things my way, it’s more fun and I can hone\nmy skills more easily.",
    "ch0029_00_asuna/2501_0701_04_10": "I have my fellow Trainers to thank for\nhelping me to realize that.",
    "ch0029_00_asuna/2501_0702_01_10": "It can be tough to do things your own way,\nbut it’s not impossible.",
    "ch0029_00_asuna/2501_0702_02_10": "There’s still so much I don’t know...",
    "ch0029_00_asuna/2501_0702_03_10": "but I’m here for you, through good times\nand bad! That’s what friends are for!",
    "ch0029_00_asuna/2511_0701_01_10": "My grandfather was one of the Elite Four,\nand I always looked up to him.",
    "ch0029_00_asuna/2511_0701_02_10": "But you know, just because you look up to\nsomebody doesn’t mean you have to be just\nlike them. I can never be my grandfather.",
    "ch0029_00_asuna/2511_0701_03_10": "So now I’m aiming to be the best version\nof myself I can possibly be!",
    "ch0029_00_asuna/2511_0701_04_10": "Just watch me! With you by my side, I feel\nlike there’s no limit to how strong and how\nfired up I can get!",
    "ch0029_00_asuna/2511_0702_01_10": "I think I was able to become such good\nfriends with you because I felt comfortable\njust being myself.",
    "ch0029_00_asuna/2511_0702_02_10": "I hope that when I become the best version of\nmyself, you’ll have reached that same point, too!",
    "ch0029_00_asuna/3001_0701_01_10": "Good morning!\nA greeting will light your fire for the whole day!",
    "ch0029_00_asuna/3002_0701_01_10": "Morning! Guess what!\nI’m going to start my day with a cold shower!",
    "ch0029_00_asuna/3003_0701_01_10": "Good afternoon! The sun is shining!\nI’m feeling really upbeat!",
    "ch0029_00_asuna/3004_0701_01_10": "Good afternoon! How are you feeling?\nMe? You know I’m on fire!",
    "ch0029_00_asuna/3005_0701_01_10": "Good evening!\nFire shines especially bright at night.\nUm, but it’s also important to rest!",
    "ch0029_00_asuna/3006_0701_01_10": "Good, uh...evening...\nN-no, I wasn’t just dozing off!",
