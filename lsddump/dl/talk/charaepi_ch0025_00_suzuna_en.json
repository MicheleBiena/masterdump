    "charaepi_ch0025_00_suzuna/2301_1201_3000_10": "but she chased me away.",
    "charaepi_ch0025_00_suzuna/2301_1201_3100_10": "Not to be mean or anything.\nShe did it to keep me away from danger.",
    "charaepi_ch0025_00_suzuna/2301_1201_3200_10": "You see, whenever Abomasnow is around,\nbig, strong blizzards tend to form...\nI think she wanted to protect me from them.",
    "charaepi_ch0025_00_suzuna/2301_1201_3300_10": "I wasn’t gonna let a little blizzard stop\nme, though! I hiked right through those\nstorms to visit her over and over again.",
    "charaepi_ch0025_00_suzuna/2301_1201_3400_10": "It took a while, but eventually Abomasnow\ngave in and said yes!",
    "charaepi_ch0025_00_suzuna/2301_0301_3500_10": "Your focus must have convinced her!",
    "charaepi_ch0025_00_suzuna/2301_0401_3600_10": "I think so! My perfect focus somehow\nmelted through that icy heart of hers.",

    "charaepi_ch0025_00_suzuna/2301_0401_4300_10": "Well, I think Abomasnow might have said yes\nthat day because she was worried about me.",
    "charaepi_ch0025_00_suzuna/2301_0302_4400_10": "What changed your mind?",
    "charaepi_ch0025_00_suzuna/2301_0402_4500_10": "Well, I think Abomasnow might have said yes\nthat day because she was worried about me.",
    "charaepi_ch0025_00_suzuna/2301_1201_4600_10": "If I’d continued to visit her up in the mountains,\nI would’ve been pelted by her blizzard nonstop.\nAt some point, I would have frozen over.",
    "charaepi_ch0025_00_suzuna/2301_1201_4700_10": "Abomasnow wanted to prevent that\nfrom happening, and I believe that kindness\nis what makes her strong.",
    "charaepi_ch0025_00_suzuna/2301_1201_4800_10": "I never found the snow flower I’d gone\nsearching for on the mountain that day...",
    "charaepi_ch0025_00_suzuna/2301_1201_4900_10": "but in the end, I found something even\nmore special than that.",
