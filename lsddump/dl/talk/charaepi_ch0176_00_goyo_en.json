    "charaepi_ch0176_00_goyo/2301_1201_0300_10": "Oh, it’s no problem! Take your time!",
    "charaepi_ch0176_00_goyo/2301_1201_0400_10": "No, that wouldn’t be right. Hmm... What to do...",
    "charaepi_ch0176_00_goyo/2301_0301_0500_10": "What’s going on?",
    "charaepi_ch0176_00_goyo/2301_0401_0600_10": "Oh, [Name:PlayerNickname ]! Well...",
    "charaepi_ch0176_00_goyo/2301_0302_0700_10": "Is something wrong?",
    "charaepi_ch0176_00_goyo/2301_0402_0800_10": "Oh, [Name:PlayerNickname ]! Well...",
    "charaepi_ch0176_00_goyo/2301_1201_0900_10": "Acerola has lent me a compilation of legends and\nfolklore from the Alola region.",
    "charaepi_ch0176_00_goyo/2301_1201_1000_10": "But since I’ve only just arrived on Pasio, I’m so\nbusy that I don’t think I’ll have much time to read.",
    "charaepi_ch0176_00_goyo/2301_1201_1100_10": "It’s a very precious book, so I really shouldn’t keep\nit for too long...",
    "charaepi_ch0176_00_goyo/2301_1201_1200_10": "You really don’t need to worry about it!",
    "charaepi_ch0176_00_goyo/2301_1201_1300_10": "That’s very kind of you to say...",
    "charaepi_ch0176_00_goyo/2301_1201_1400_10": "I really am looking forward to reading the book.\nI would like to start it soon.",
    "charaepi_ch0176_00_goyo/2301_1201_1500_10": "That being said, I can’t neglect my training to\nprepare for battling here on Pasio.",

    "charaepi_ch0176_00_goyo/2301_0401_1800_10": "The answer lies with Girafarig’s heads.",
    "charaepi_ch0176_00_goyo/2301_0302_1900_10": "Because of its heads?",
    "charaepi_ch0176_00_goyo/2301_0402_2000_10": "Well observed. Yes, precisely that.",
    "charaepi_ch0176_00_goyo/2301_1201_2100_10": "Girafarig has two heads—a front one and a\nrear one.",
    "charaepi_ch0176_00_goyo/2301_1201_2200_10": "The rear head isn’t the best thinker, but it’s very\ngood at battling. It also has no need for sleep.",
    "charaepi_ch0176_00_goyo/2301_1201_2300_10": "Because of that, it can keep a constant eye on its\nsurroundings while the front head is sleeping.",
    "charaepi_ch0176_00_goyo/2301_1201_2400_10": "Even though they share the same body! What a\nstrange Pokémon!",
    "charaepi_ch0176_00_goyo/2301_1201_2500_10": "Indeed. Sometimes I wish that I also had two\nheads: one that could stay up late reading as\nmuch as I wish...",
    "charaepi_ch0176_00_goyo/2301_1201_2600_10": "and one that could concentrate on battling, as a\nmember of the Elite Four should.",
    "charaepi_ch0176_00_goyo/2301_1201_2700_10": "But of course that’s entirely unrealistic.",

    "charaepi_ch0176_00_goyo/2301_1201_2900_10": "Time is a limited resource, after all, and I try to\nmake good use of it.",
    "charaepi_ch0176_00_goyo/2301_1201_3000_10": "Hmm, maybe I’ll read books, too, while I’m waiting\nfor challengers at the League in Alola!",
    "charaepi_ch0176_00_goyo/2301_1201_3100_10": "Yes, go ahead. I recommend it.",
    "charaepi_ch0176_00_goyo/2301_1201_3200_10": "Oh, Acerola!",
    "charaepi_ch0176_00_goyo/2301_1201_3300_10": "I came to return the book you lent me as\nreference material!",
    "charaepi_ch0176_00_goyo/2301_1201_3400_10": "Oh, you must be—",
    "charaepi_ch0176_00_goyo/2301_1201_3500_10": "Oh, I know! Shauntal, why don’t you have Lucian\nread your book? He loves reading, too!",

    "charaepi_ch0176_00_goyo/2301_1201_3900_10": "So you are an author, as I thought! Yes, of course\nI’d love to read it.",
    "charaepi_ch0176_00_goyo/2301_1201_4000_10": "But at this rate...even two heads won’t be enough.",
