    "ch0013_00_hapu/0101_0701_02_10": "I wonder what grand adventures await us today!\nCome, it’s time for some fun!\n",
    "ch0013_00_hapu/0601_0701_01_10": "You know, people speak in a most peculiar\nfashion in this city! I noticed that on\nother islands in Alola as well.",
    "ch0013_00_hapu/0601_0701_02_10": "My own venerable grandfather is the only one\nI had to emulate growing up, so I am not\nfamiliar with your hip, groovy slang.",
    "ch0013_00_hapu/0601_0701_03_10": "“Hip” and “groovy” are modern\nslang words...right?",
    "ch0013_00_hapu/0601_0701_04_10": "Well, either way, I have gotten used\nto saying them now, and that’s not\nlikely to change.",
    "ch0013_00_hapu/0601_0702_01_10": "Ho! Well met, friend! Such fine weather\nwe’re having today, don’t you think?\nWait, no, GROOVY weather, huh?! ",
    "ch0013_00_hapu/0601_0702_02_10": "*sigh* This is more difficult than I thought.\nPerhaps big city slang and I were not\nmeant to mix!",
    "ch0013_00_hapu/0602_0701_01_10": "The bond I share with my Mudsdale is not\nmerely that of Trainer and Pokémon!",
    "ch0013_00_hapu/0602_0701_02_10": "He lets me ride on his back, of course, and\nhe carries heavy cargo. He lends us his\nstrength to plow the fields.",
    "ch0013_00_hapu/0602_0701_03_10": "The farm would never survive without\nMudsdale’s help! Shoot, life on the island\njust wouldn’t be the same without him!",
    "ch0013_00_hapu/0602_0701_04_10": "My grandfather always used to say people and\nPokémon were made to help one another—\nI really feel the truth of those words now!",
    "ch0013_00_hapu/0602_0702_01_10": "There are some hurdles I can’t jump over alone,\nbut together, my Mudsdale and I can overcome\nthem all!",
    "ch0013_00_hapu/0602_0702_02_10": "And before we know it, we are covered from\nhead to toe in mud! Two peas in a pod, we are!",
    "ch0013_00_hapu/0603_0701_01_10": "There was this one time, before I\nwas the Island Kahuna...",
    "ch0013_00_hapu/0603_0701_02_10": "I was taking a stroll along the beach when I felt\nan odd squishy sensation under my toes—\nI had accidentally stepped on a Gastrodon!",
    "ch0013_00_hapu/0603_0701_03_10": "Some purple liquid was oozing out of it,\nso I leaned down to see if it was hurt—and\nit started healing itself right before my eyes!",
    "ch0013_00_hapu/0603_0702_01_10": "The heartiness of that little Gastrodon\nwas truly a sight to behold, I tell you!",
    "ch0013_00_hapu/0603_0702_02_10": "The texture of its gooey body and its cry\nwere so...edgy. Ahh, I’d love to\nsee one again.",
    "ch0013_00_hapu/0604_0701_01_10": "Before I was chosen to be an island kahuna,\nI journeyed throughout Alola to prove my worth\nto the guardian deity, Tapu Fini.",
    "ch0013_00_hapu/0604_0701_02_10": "And that got me thinking, what if I extend my\njourney beyond the Alolan islands?\nAround the world!",
    "ch0013_00_hapu/0604_0701_03_10": "That is how I came to participate in\nthe PML here on Pasio.",
    "ch0013_00_hapu/0604_0702_01_10": "I wonder how my grandmother and the others\nare getting on back in Alola.",
    "ch0013_00_hapu/0604_0702_02_10": "I will have a thousand stories to share\nwith them when I return home!",
    "ch0013_00_hapu/0605_0701_01_10": "You are a truly devoted Trainer,\n[Name:PlayerNickname ]! There’s never a dull\nmoment when you’re around.",
    "ch0013_00_hapu/0605_0701_02_10": "Sometimes, when we’re together, I feel as\nthough a hidden power deep inside\nof me is awakening!",
    "ch0013_00_hapu/0605_0701_03_10": "Hmm! Hapu’s hidden power.\nAnything could Hapun!",
    "ch0013_00_hapu/0605_0701_04_10": "Hmph! On second thought, forget what I\njust said! It was not as punny as I thought.",
    "ch0013_00_hapu/0605_0701_05_10": "It’ll be our little secret! \nPromise you won’t tell a soul!\n",
    "ch0013_00_hapu/0605_0702_01_10": "Good puns have a way of sticking into\nyour memory like glue.",
    "ch0013_00_hapu/0605_0702_02_10": "If you ever come up with a good one,\ndo share it with me!",
    "ch0013_00_hapu/1701_0701_01_10": "Oh! You came at just the right time.\nI was just thinking of giving you this!",
    "ch0013_00_hapu/1701_0701_02_10": "Whenever I go out on strolls, I tend to\npick up new ideas and occasionally\nsome knickknacks!",
    "ch0013_00_hapu/1701_0702_01_10": "Here, don’t be shy!\nThis is my way of saying thank you.",
    "ch0013_00_hapu/2501_0701_01_10": "You never fail to surprise me when it comes\nto Pokémon battling.",
    "ch0013_00_hapu/2501_0701_02_10": "However, you are still but a rough-hewn stone.\nAs an island kahuna, I feel it is my duty\nto guide you and polish you to greatness!",
    "ch0013_00_hapu/2501_0701_03_10": "What? Oh, I meant no offense, friend!",
    "ch0013_00_hapu/2501_0701_04_10": "There is still much for me to learn\non my own journey as well!\nWe shall learn and grow together!",
    "ch0013_00_hapu/2501_0702_01_10": "There is so much that we can still learn.\nThe world is an open book!",
    "ch0013_00_hapu/2501_0702_02_10": "The more you learn, the more you grow!",
    "ch0013_00_hapu/2511_0701_01_10": "Hmm. There is still so much I do not\nknow about this place.",
    "ch0013_00_hapu/2511_0701_02_10": "I did not come here for sightseeing,\nbut journeying around the world like this\nis a remarkable experience, indeed!",
    "ch0013_00_hapu/2511_0701_03_10": "Are you familiar with this area?\nIt would be grand if you could show\nme around sometime.",
    "ch0013_00_hapu/2511_0702_01_10": "I want to go back to my grandmother and\nthe rest of the family with plenty of\nstories to tell!",
    "ch0013_00_hapu/2511_0702_02_10": "If you happen across any extraordinary\ntidbits, be sure to let me know!",
    "ch0013_00_hapu/2511_0702_03_10": "My trust in your recommendations\nis absolute!",
    "ch0013_00_hapu/3001_0701_01_10": "Ah, you’re awake!\nHaving to tend to the fields every morning\nhas made me an early riser.",
    "ch0013_00_hapu/3002_0701_01_10": "It is good to wake up early!\nYou should make the most of the time you have!",
    "ch0013_00_hapu/3003_0701_01_10": "Good afternoon, friend!\nNow is the time to relax and take a stroll.\n",
    "ch0013_00_hapu/3004_0701_01_10": "Alola!\nThis is how we greet people in my hometown.",
    "ch0013_00_hapu/3005_0701_01_10": "On the island, things get quite sleepy\nonce the sun goes down. But I think I\ncan hold out a little longer today!",
    "ch0013_00_hapu/3006_0701_01_10": "Good evening! I have heard that at night\nthe city never sleeps! But I am sleepy!",
