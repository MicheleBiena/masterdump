    "episode_event_halloween_2021/4004_1001_0400_10": "Well, we already know there’s gonna be traps\nand stuff. When we run into them, it probably\nwon’t even be...",

    "episode_event_halloween_2021/4004_1001_0600_10": "It looks like this room has been decorated\nwith masks...",

    "episode_event_halloween_2021/4004_0402_1200_10": "Y-yeah, I heard it! What do you think it was?",
    "episode_event_halloween_2021/4004_1001_1300_10": "It sounded like someone knocked over a vase\nto me.",

    "episode_event_halloween_2021/4004_1001_1500_10": "Th-there are eyes in the masks?!",
    "episode_event_halloween_2021/4004_1001_1600_10": "Ahh! Did you hear THAT?!",
    "episode_event_halloween_2021/4004_1001_1700_10": "It sounded like a Pokémon’s cry.",
    "episode_event_halloween_2021/4004_1001_1800_10": "*chuckle* Specters and spooks indeed.",
    "episode_event_halloween_2021/4004_1001_1900_10": "How are both of you so c-calm right now?!",
    "episode_event_halloween_2021/4004_1001_2000_10": "I...don’t really know how to answer that.",
    "episode_event_halloween_2021/4004_1001_2100_10": "Ah, it looks like the ghost Pokémon have come\nout to welcome us.",
    "episode_event_halloween_2021/4004_1001_2200_10": "If by “welcome” you mean bare their teeth in\nopen hostility toward us...",
    "episode_event_halloween_2021/4004_1001_2300_10": "This could be an excellent training opportunity!",
    "episode_event_halloween_2021/4004_1001_2400_10": "One day, a Legendary Pokémon will appear\nbefore me. I have to train to prepare myself!",
    "episode_event_halloween_2021/4004_1001_2500_10": "Looks like Banette is ready for a fight, too!",
    "episode_event_halloween_2021/4004_1001_2600_10": "Morty...are you actually enjoying this?!",
    "episode_event_halloween_2021/4004_1001_2700_10": "Of course! Now, let’s battle, shall we?",
    "episode_event_halloween_2021/4004_1001_2800_10": "This Midnight Spookfest is my kind of party!",
    "episode_event_halloween_2021/4004_1001_2900_10": "To rush at us out of the blue like that...\nGhost Pokémon are full of surprises, aren’t they.",
    "episode_event_halloween_2021/4004_1001_3000_10": "Much of what you do is still a mystery to\nme, Sableye.",
    "episode_event_halloween_2021/4004_1001_3100_10": "I hope participating in the Spookfest allows me\nto learn a bit more about you—and about ghost\nPokémon as well.",
    "episode_event_halloween_2021/4004_1001_3200_10": "I still don’t understand how both of you are\nso unfazed by all of this...",
    "episode_event_halloween_2021/4004_1001_3300_10": "But we’ll do our best, too! Go, Mightyena!",
    "episode_event_halloween_2021/4004_0301_3400_10": "Look! There are more of them!",
    "episode_event_halloween_2021/4004_0401_3500_10": "You OK, [Name:PlayerNickname ]?!\nCome on, we’ll get through this together!",
    "episode_event_halloween_2021/4004_0302_3600_10": "More ghost Pokémon!",
    "episode_event_halloween_2021/4004_0402_3700_10": "Careful, [Name:PlayerNickname ]!\nJust stay calm—we’ll face this together!",
    "episode_event_halloween_2021/4004_1001_3800_10": "I never knew ghost Pokémon were so aggressive...",
    "episode_event_halloween_2021/4004_1001_3900_10": "If this is all just an act for the Spookfest, it sure\nis a convincing one!",
    "episode_event_halloween_2021/4004_1001_4000_10": "Phew... Nice job everybody. Looks like we\nmanaged to drive them off.",
    "episode_event_halloween_2021/4004_1001_4100_10": "Shall we brush ourselves off and get\nmoving again?",
    "episode_event_halloween_2021/4004_1001_4200_10": "Hm?",
    "episode_event_halloween_2021/4004_1001_4300_10": "Is that another ghost Pokémon?",
    "episode_event_halloween_2021/4004_1001_4400_10": "Let’s tread carefully. It might rush up and attack\nlike the last ones!",
    "episode_event_halloween_2021/4004_1001_4500_10": "Hang on... I don’t sense any hostility from\nthis Pumpkaboo.",
    "episode_event_halloween_2021/4004_1001_4600_10": "I don’t think it means to start a fight.",
    "episode_event_halloween_2021/4004_1001_4700_10": "Then...what is it doing here?",
    "episode_event_halloween_2021/4004_1001_4800_10": "Perhaps it wants us to follow it.",
    "episode_event_halloween_2021/4004_1001_4900_10": "Interesting... It could be trying to lead\nus somewhere.",
    "episode_event_halloween_2021/4004_1001_5000_10": "Hmm... What do you think we should do,\n[Name:PlayerNickname ]?",
    "episode_event_halloween_2021/4004_0301_5100_10": "Let’s follow it.",
    "episode_event_halloween_2021/4004_0401_5200_10": "*gulp* If you think that’s what we should do,\nthen I guess I’m with you...",
    "episode_event_halloween_2021/4004_0302_5300_10": "It could be a trap.",
    "episode_event_halloween_2021/4004_0402_5400_10": "*gulp* It sure could be...",
    "episode_event_halloween_2021/4004_1001_5500_10": "What are we waiting for? Let’s go.",
    "episode_event_halloween_2021/4004_1001_5600_10": "We’ll be fine as long as we all stick together.",
    "episode_event_halloween_2021/4004_1001_5700_10": "I wonder where it’ll lead us...",
    "episode_event_halloween_2021/4005_1001_0100_10": "Huh?! What is this place?",
    "episode_event_halloween_2021/4005_1001_0200_10": "How did we get to this cave from the villa?",
    "episode_event_halloween_2021/4005_1001_0300_10": "Could it be...",
    "episode_event_halloween_2021/4005_1001_0400_10": "Pumpkaboo are said to carry wandering spirits to\nthe place they belong so that they can move on.",
    "episode_event_halloween_2021/4005_1001_0500_10": "This place could be a bridge to the afterlife...",
    "episode_event_halloween_2021/4005_1001_0600_10": "You think it might be trying to usher our spirits\naway with it?",
    "episode_event_halloween_2021/4005_1001_0700_10": "Wha—?! Now’s not the time for calm analysis,\nyou two!",
    "episode_event_halloween_2021/4005_1001_0800_10": "I propose we turn back and get out of here...",
    "episode_event_halloween_2021/4006_1001_0100_10": "Phew! We made it...back safely...",
    "episode_event_halloween_2021/4006_1001_0200_10": "I didn’t think I’d be guided into the afterlife\nthis evening...",
    "episode_event_halloween_2021/4006_1001_0300_10": "You could have at least mentioned that\nPumpkaboo like to carry spirits to their\nresting place, you know...",
    "episode_event_halloween_2021/4006_1001_0400_10": "Well, I thought it might be rude to say no if\nthat’s what it was really trying to do.",

    "episode_event_halloween_2021/4006_1001_0600_10": "I’m sure it depends on the person...",
    "episode_event_halloween_2021/4006_1001_0700_10": "*sigh* I guess this event turned out to be a lot\nmore grim than we thought, huh...",

    "episode_event_halloween_2021/4006_1001_0900_10": "Ahh! I think something just touched my leg!",
    "episode_event_halloween_2021/4006_1001_1000_10": "It looks like a mask...",
    "episode_event_halloween_2021/4006_1001_1100_10": "Do you think someone might have dropped it?\nOr is this just another decoration like that\nother room...",
    "episode_event_halloween_2021/4006_1001_1200_10": "Hard to say. We might as well bring it with us,\nthough, in case somebody lost it.",
    "episode_event_halloween_2021/4006_1001_1300_10": "This has been quite a journey so far...but if I’m\nnot mistaken, that should be the final room\nup ahead.",

    "episode_event_halloween_2021/4008_1001_2900_10": "However...I think you may have inadvertently\ngiven the other participants quite a scare.",

    "episode_event_halloween_2021/4008_1001_3100_10": "So now we need to work extra hard to show\nthem all how wonderful ghost Pokémon can be!",

    "episode_event_halloween_2021/4009_1001_0200_10": "What? Tonight’s been sooo much fun!",
    "episode_event_halloween_2021/4009_1001_0300_10": "Huh?",
    "episode_event_halloween_2021/4009_1001_0400_10": "No need to apologize! We’re all aware of\nwhat happened.",
    "episode_event_halloween_2021/4009_1001_0500_10": "Young [Name:PlayerNickname ] and the others\nexplained it to us before you arrived.",

    "episode_event_halloween_2021/4009_1001_1100_10": "Woo-hoo! Allister, bring the ghost Pokémon\nover here!",
    "episode_event_halloween_2021/4009_1001_1200_10": "Come on, Allister! I want to introduce you\nto everyone!",
    "episode_event_halloween_2021/4009_1001_1300_10": "R-right...",
    "episode_event_halloween_2021/4009_1001_1400_10": "Was what you said to Allister earlier true?\nThat you love ghost Pokémon even more now?",
