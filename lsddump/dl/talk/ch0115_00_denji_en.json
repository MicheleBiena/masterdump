    "ch0115_00_denji/0101_0701_02_10": "I know you’re no stranger to rousing adventure.\nEnjoy yourself out there.",
    "ch0115_00_denji/0601_0701_01_10": "I was invited to join the Elite Four once when I\nwas in Sinnoh, but I had to turn them down.",
    "ch0115_00_denji/0601_0701_02_10": "They told me in no uncertain terms that I couldn’t\nrenovate the Pokémon League building, so I\nlost interest.",
    "ch0115_00_denji/0601_0701_03_10": "Well, no, I just thought that I’d rather be a Gym\nLeader where I could meet ordinary folks.",
    "ch0115_00_denji/0602_0701_01_10": "Pasio is an artificial island. The environments here,\nlike the forests, volcanoes, and glaciers, are all\nmaintained by machines.",
    "ch0115_00_denji/0602_0701_02_10": "But what kind of machines? And how exactly do\nthey work? I’m so curious...",
    "ch0115_00_denji/0602_0701_03_10": "Aren’t you curious, too? I just can’t stop thinking\nabout it.",
    "ch0115_00_denji/0603_0701_01_10": "The roads in Sunyshore City, where my Gym is\nlocated, are actually solar panels.",
    "ch0115_00_denji/0603_0701_02_10": "They convert sunlight into electricity.",
    "ch0115_00_denji/0603_0701_03_10": "That gives us plenty of electricity to use and makes\nit a great place to live. I’d definitely recommend it\nif you’re thinking about moving somewhere!",
    "ch0115_00_denji/0604_0701_01_10": "Do you and your partner Pokémon have a special\nmove you can use as your trump card?",
    "ch0115_00_denji/0604_0701_02_10": "You know, something extra special to keep in\nreserve until the time is right.",
    "ch0115_00_denji/0604_0701_03_10": "If not, you should definitely come up with one. I’m\nlooking forward to seeing what electrifying move\nyou call your trump card!",
    "ch0115_00_denji/0605_0701_01_10": "Hey, [Name:PlayerNickname ]. Do you have\nany moves that hold a special place in your heart?\nMaybe one you just really like?",
    "ch0115_00_denji/0605_0701_02_10": "When I got my first Gym Badge, I used the\nmove Thunderbolt.",
    "ch0115_00_denji/0605_0701_03_10": "I’ll never forget the electrifying sensation I felt at\nthat moment—or the joy it sparked in my heart.",
    "ch0115_00_denji/1701_0701_01_10": "Oh, there you are.",
    "ch0115_00_denji/1701_0701_02_10": "I wanted you to have this.",
    "ch0115_00_denji/1701_0702_01_10": "Put it to use however you see fit.",
    "ch0115_00_denji/1701_0702_02_10": "The stronger you get as a Trainer, the happier I’ll\nbe to battle you!",
    "ch0115_00_denji/2501_0701_01_10": "What do you think about the machines here on\nPasio? They’re interesting, huh?",
    "ch0115_00_denji/2501_0701_02_10": "Soon after I arrived here, I found an unusual\nmachine in town. I tried to do some renovations\nto it...",
    "ch0115_00_denji/2501_0701_03_10": "but that caused a partial power outage. I got\nquite an earful from the PML staff afterward.",
    "ch0115_00_denji/2501_0701_04_10": "But to tell you the truth, seeing how mad they got\nabout it just made me even more curious about the\nkinds of machines they have here.",
    "ch0115_00_denji/2501_0702_01_10": "I used to renovate my Gym all the time back\nin Sinnoh.",
    "ch0115_00_denji/2501_0702_02_10": "I ended up using so much electricity that it\ncaused blackouts all over the city. I got so\nmany complaints...",
    "ch0115_00_denji/2511_0701_01_10": "Do you know Flint? He’s one of Sinnoh’s Elite Four.",
    "ch0115_00_denji/2511_0701_02_10": "Somehow we always seem to wind up doing\nstuff together, almost like we’re stuck with each\nother, for better or worse.",
    "ch0115_00_denji/2511_0701_03_10": "Don’t get me wrong—he’s a good guy. Maybe a\nbit too fired up for my taste, but don’t let that\nturn you off about him.",
    "ch0115_00_denji/2511_0702_01_10": "Flint’s a good guy, but sometimes he does the\nstrangest things.",
    "ch0115_00_denji/2511_0702_02_10": "Recently, he tried to challenge me to a Pokémon\nbattle inside the villa! I swear, that guy can be\nreally irresponsible sometimes.",
    "ch0115_00_denji/3001_0701_01_10": "What’s the matter? Still sleepy? Then how about a\nbattle? That ought to shock you wide awake!",
    "ch0115_00_denji/3003_0701_01_10": "I wonder how they built Pasio...\nAnd how do they keep everything running?",
    "ch0115_00_denji/3005_0701_01_10": "Be careful not to waste electricity at night. \nWe can get in a lot of trouble if we cause\nan outage.",
