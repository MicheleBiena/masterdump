    "episode_event_summer_2022/4001_1001_1200_10": "OK, Hilda.",

    "episode_event_summer_2022/4001_1001_1700_10": "I see. And what about those round things shaped\nlike Applin and Munna?",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4001_1001_1800_10": "Those are candy apples. They’re whole apples\ncoated with supersweet candy!",

    "episode_event_summer_2022/4201_1001_0200_10": "Do you really have to focus and prepare that much\njust to have fun at a festival?",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4201_1001_0300_10": "Of course, silly! Figuring out how to maximize\nyour pocket money to have the most fun is\nsuper important!",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4201_1001_0400_10": "So we give it our all in battles, and we should\nalso do the same when we’re having fun?",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4201_1001_0500_10": "Exactly! So come on—let’s get going!",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4002_1001_0100_10": "I’m definitely gonna get a winner this time!",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4002_1001_0200_10": "Haha, nice try! Here’s a potion as a\nconsolation prize.",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4002_1001_0300_10": "Aw, c’mon! Three duds in a row...",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4002_1001_0400_10": "C’mon, Hilda. Enough Pokémon lottery already.",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4002_1001_0500_10": "I see... So if you get a winner, you can\nget prizes like Pokémon plushies.",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4002_1001_0600_10": "I’d like to give it a try.",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4002_1001_0700_10": "Sure! Just don’t expect to win on your first—",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4002_1001_0800_10": "Whoa, congratulations, dude! You’ve won the\nsecond prize—a set of Pokémon plushies!",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4002_1001_0900_10": "Thank you.",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4002_1001_1000_10": "Seriously? You won in one try?!",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4002_1001_1100_10": "Did you want a prize, Hilda? You can have one\nof these plushies, if you like.",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4002_1001_1200_10": "Nah. It’s not as fun if you don’t win it on\nyour own!",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4002_1001_1300_10": "As long as I have the will to win, I’m sure this\nnext one will be a winner!",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4002_1001_1400_10": "Now, Sirfetch’d! Take up your fighting stance!",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4002_1001_1500_10": "Was that Bea’s voice I heard just now?",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4002_1001_1600_10": "She must be having a battle somewhere.",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4002_1001_1700_10": "Wait—did you say “battle”?!",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4002_1001_1800_10": "I wanna battle, too! Let’s find her, quick!",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4002_1001_1900_10": "Ack! Hilda, wait up! What about the lottery?",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4003_1001_0100_10": "Hey, who were you just battling? Where’s\nyour opponent? Where’d they go?!",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4003_1001_0200_10": "Oh, are you here because you heard\nBea shouting?",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4003_1001_0300_10": "That wasn’t a battle.",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4003_1001_0400_10": "Lyra told me that people dance at summer\nfestivals, so I was practicing for that.",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4003_1001_0500_10": "I thought I’d incorporate some Galar karate into\nmy dancing.",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4003_1001_0600_10": "Yeah! Dancing is the perfect finale for a summer\nfestival. It’s a whole event in itself! ",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4003_1001_0700_10": "Aw, so it wasn’t a battle after all...",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4003_1001_0800_10": "But now that I think about it, a summer festival\ndance might also be pretty fun!",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4003_1001_0900_10": "Wait a moment—that Grapploct...",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4003_1001_1000_10": "You noticed?",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4003_1001_1100_10": "Yeah, she’s from the Egg you gave me before!\nThe little Clobbopus that hatched from it sure has\ngrown up!",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4003_1001_1200_10": "I can tell you’ve taken good care of her.\nShe’s truly a fine Grapploct.",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4003_1001_1300_10": "Thanks, Bea!",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4003_1001_1400_10": "By the way, do you wanna see how strong\nwe’ve gotten?",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4003_1001_1500_10": "Yes. As a matter of fact, that’s precisely what I\nwas thinking just now.",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4003_1001_1600_10": "OK, let’s find a place...",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4003_1001_1700_10": "...where we can battle!",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4003_1001_1800_10": "Wow, Hilda’s already battling! She sure has a lot\nof energy.",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4003_1001_1900_10": "She really seems to be enjoying herself.",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4003_1001_2000_10": "Hilda shines the brightest when she’s battling.",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4004_1001_0100_10": "I wonder where Hilda went, anyway.",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4004_1001_0200_10": "She might’ve gotten more sync pairs to battle her.",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4004_1001_0300_10": "Yeah, that’s definitely a possibility...",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4004_1001_0400_10": "Sorry, you two!",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4004_1001_0500_10": "My plan was to come right back after I finished\nthat battle with Bea...",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4004_1001_0600_10": "But then I got distracted by this really cool stall\nwith a target practice game and lost track\nof time.",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4004_1001_0700_10": "Yup, sounds like something you’d do.",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4004_1001_0800_10": "I can just imagine your giddy face as you played.",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4004_1001_0900_10": "Hey! Stop treating me like a kid, you two!",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4004_1001_1000_10": "I mean... I guess it is true that I’ve been the one\ngetting the most excited about all the games and\nstuff, but still...",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4004_1001_1100_10": "Anyway, check out these prizes I won! Here, I got\none for each of you!",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4004_1001_1200_10": "Oh, is this a pendant? There’s a little rock attached\nto it.",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4004_1001_1300_10": "Yeah! They’re replicas of these things called\nwishing stars!",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4004_1001_1400_10": "Apparently, they’re these special rocks from Galar!\nThey’re said to grant wishes!",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4004_1001_1500_10": "And now all three of us have one! ",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4004_1001_1600_10": "Let’s keep them as mementos of the fun\nwe’re having today at this festival!",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4004_1001_1700_10": "My wish will be for us to become even\nbetter friends!",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4004_1001_1800_10": "Thanks, Hilda. I’ll take good care of this.",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4005_1001_0100_10": "This is such a lovely gift.",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4005_1001_0200_10": "I’ll have to get you something in return.",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4005_1001_0300_10": "Hm? Those rocks you’ve got there...",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4005_1001_0400_10": "I won them at the target practice game!",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4005_1001_0500_10": "They’re wishing star replicas. The three of us\nare going to keep them as mementos of this\nfun summer festival!",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4005_1001_0600_10": "Wishing star replicas, eh?",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4005_1001_0700_10": "I hope you’re not disappointed.",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4005_1001_0800_10": "Not at all! Even if they’re replicas, those rocks are\nnow full of all your feelings.",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4005_1001_0900_10": "Because of that, they shine just as bright as the\nreal thing.",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4005_1001_1000_10": "Thank you.",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4005_1001_1100_10": "Do you know much about stones?\nIf so, I have a question for you.",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4005_1001_1200_10": "I'm wondering what kind of stone I should get for\nHilda in return. I’d like to get her something that\nwill make her happy.",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4005_1001_1300_10": "Hm... Well, Hilda’s always bright and strong, so\nI think a Sun Stone or a Shiny Stone would be\ngreat for her! Or maybe—",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4005_1001_1400_10": "Step right up! It’s time for a special game!",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4005_1001_1500_10": "Hm? Isn’t that—?",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4005_1001_1600_10": "Hey! That’s Team Break!",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4006_1001_0100_10": "We should go over there and teach them a lesson!",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4006_1001_0200_10": "Wait, Hilda! Maybe we shouldn’t be so quick to\npick a fight with them.",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4006_1001_0300_10": "By all appearances, they’re just operating a\nfestival stall.",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4006_1001_0400_10": "Why don’t we keep an eye on what they’re doing,\njust in case?",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4006_1001_0500_10": "If you say so... I guess I’ll stand down.",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4006_1001_0600_10": "Oooh, what’s going on?",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4006_1001_0700_10": "The rules are simple!",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4006_1001_0800_10": "All you have to do is select the two Poké Balls\nthat have Pokémon inside them out of four!",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4006_1001_0900_10": "Remember, only TWO have Pokémon in them.\nThe other two are empty!",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4006_1001_1000_10": "Since two out of four have Pokémon inside,\nyou have a 50 percent chance of winning!",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4006_1001_1100_10": "If you’re able to find the Poké Balls with Pokémon\nin them twice in a row, we’ll give you a\nMythical Pokémon!",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4006_1001_1200_10": "Hm... I mean, they’re calling it a game, but...",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4006_1001_1300_10": "They’re giving out Pokémon as prizes?",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4006_1001_1400_10": "... ... ...",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4006_1001_1500_10": "Don’t forget, this is your chance to win yourself\na Mythical Pokémon!",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4006_1001_1600_10": "Of course, there’s a price to participate. The entry\nfee is any type of treasure you’ve got on hand!",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4006_1001_1700_10": "OK, I’ll give it a whirl!",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4006_1001_1800_10": "Sure thing!",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4006_1001_1900_10": "Hey, you! Hurry up and lay out the Poké Balls!",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4006_1001_2000_10": "Yes, sir!",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4006_1001_2100_10": "... ... ...",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4006_1001_2200_10": "I think this one looks like a winner!",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4006_1001_2300_10": "And my second choice is...this one!",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4006_1001_2400_10": "... ... ...",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4006_1001_2500_10": "Too bad! You didn’t find the Pokémon!",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4006_1001_2600_10": "Darn!",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4006_1001_2700_10": "Let me try!",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4006_1001_2800_10": "Me too!",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4006_1001_2900_10": "Sure! Go ahead, make a line!",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4006_1001_3000_10": "Oh, what a shame... You almost had it!\nGreat job finding that first Pokémon, though!",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4006_1001_3100_10": "Aw, shucks!",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4006_1001_3200_10": "Now, we’ll be keeping these treasures we\ncollected from you, as was agreed!",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4006_1001_3300_10": "Geheheheh!",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4006_1001_3400_10": "That’s weird... If the probability of finding both\nPokémon is 50 percent, why isn’t anyone winning?",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4006_1001_3500_10": "Because the probability isn’t really 50 percent.",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4006_1001_3600_10": "What do you mean?",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4006_1001_3700_10": "The 50 percent probability only applies to the\nfirst guess, where two out of the four options\nare correct. ",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4006_1001_3800_10": "But on the second guess, you’ve got three options,\nand only one is a winner. So the probability of\nselecting that winner is just one in three.",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4006_1001_3900_10": "If you calculate the overall probability of picking\na Pokémon twice in a row, the odds are actually\none in six.",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4006_1001_4000_10": "What?! That’s not even close to 50 percent!",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4006_1001_4100_10": "Yeah. Plus, it looks like there’s another reason\nwhy nobody’s winning.",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4006_1001_4200_10": "Make sure you set them out CORRECTLY. Got it?",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4006_1001_4300_10": "Heheh. Yeah, yeah, I know! ",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4006_1001_4400_10": "Hey!",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4006_1001_4500_10": "He just swapped out one of the balls!",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4006_1001_4600_10": "They took away one of the winning Poké Balls!\nIt’s impossible to win now!",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4006_1001_4700_10": "That’s some dirty, rotten cheating right there!",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4006_1001_4800_10": "Yeah...but if we try to point that out, I’m sure\nthey’ll play dumb.",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4006_1001_4900_10": "As long as nobody notices their tricks, they can\njust keep taking advantage of people!",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4006_1001_5000_10": "They’re using this festival to cheat people out of\ntheir precious treasures! How could anyone stoop\nso low?!",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4006_1001_5100_10": "Do we really have to just stand here and\nwatch this?",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4006_1001_5200_10": "Ugh! This is so frustrating! Isn’t there something\nwe can do?!",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4006_1001_5300_10": "Hmm, there might be something. I have an idea.",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4006_1001_5400_10": "Huh? What kind of idea?",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4006_1001_5500_10": "Sometimes you have to fight foul play with some\nfoul play of your own.",

    "episode_event_summer_2022/4007_1001_0300_10": "Excellent.",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4007_1001_0400_10": "And what treasure will you be offering?",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4007_1001_0500_10": "How about this?",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4007_1001_0600_10": "A pendant with a rock on it?",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4007_1001_0700_10": "It just looks like a rock. Is this thing\nactually valuable?",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4007_1001_0800_10": "Oh well. It’ll do.",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4007_1001_0900_10": "Hey, line up the balls!",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4007_1001_1000_10": "Yes, sir!",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4007_1001_1100_10": "Hm... I’ll start with that one.",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4007_1001_1200_10": "Well done! Your first guess is correct! But we’ll\nsee about the next one...",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4007_1001_1300_10": "Next, that one.",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4007_1001_1400_10": "Wh-whaaa?!",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4007_1001_1500_10": "Hooray! You won!",

    "episode_event_summer_2022/4007_1001_1700_10": "B-but how?",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4007_1001_1800_10": "We only put one correct ball there in the first\nplace, so there’s no way you could’ve—",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4007_1001_1900_10": "Huh? What did you say just now?!",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4007_1001_2000_10": "Uh... Oh, I mean, no! That was just, uh...a figure\nof speech!",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4007_1001_2100_10": "That means it was impossible to win!",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4007_1001_2200_10": "That’s right. The way he was usually setting it up,\nthere was no possible way to win.",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4007_1001_2300_10": "And yet, for some reason, you put two correct\nballs out in front of me...",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4007_1001_2400_10": "Why would you do that? Were you distracted by\nsome sort of illusion?",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4007_1001_2500_10": "What would an illusion have to do with—",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4007_1001_2600_10": "Ohhh, I get it now. Zoroark can make people\nsee illusions!",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4007_1001_2700_10": "You tricked us!",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4007_1001_2800_10": "I’d say that goes for you as well.",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4007_1001_2900_10": "At any rate, the game’s over. Now if you’d just\nreturn the treasure I—",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4007_1001_3000_10": "Shut up! Here’s your trashy treasure!",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4007_1001_3100_10": "Ah!",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4007_1001_3200_10": "H-he smashed it to pieces!",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4007_1001_3300_10": "N! I’ve had enough of this! Let’s take down Team\nBreak together!",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4007_1001_3400_10": "Yes. Let’s.",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4007_1001_3500_10": "You think YOU’VE had enough? What about us?!\nHey, you! Get over here!",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4007_1001_3600_10": "If it’s three we’re up against, then I’m joining\nyou two!",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4007_1001_3700_10": "Let’s go! The three of us together’ll really teach\n’em a lesson!",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4008_1001_0100_10": "Ngah!",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4008_1001_0200_10": "Th-they got us!",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4008_1001_0300_10": "Now you’re gonna give back every single treasure\nyou took from people here. You got that?!",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4008_1001_0400_10": "And about that Mythical Pokémon you claimed to\nhave as a prize...",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4008_1001_0500_10": "That was just a lie to get people to play\nthe game!",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4008_1001_0600_10": "We haven’t caught any Mythical Pokémon!",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4008_1001_0700_10": "*sigh* I thought that was probably the case.",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4008_1001_0800_10": "I’ve had enough of your lies! If you try anything\nawful like this again...",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4008_1001_0900_10": "Eeek! We won’t—we promise!",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4008_1001_1000_10": "That was a good battle.",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4008_1001_1100_10": "I’d love to battle with you all myself sometime.",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4008_1001_1200_10": "Yeah, definitely!",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4008_1001_1300_10": "Ahhh, that felt good!",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4008_1001_1400_10": "I’m so sorry, Hilda. The present you gave me—it...",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4008_1001_1500_10": "Oh, you don’t need to worry for my sake.",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4008_1001_1600_10": "But...",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4008_1001_1700_10": "The only thing they broke was that pendant.",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4008_1001_1800_10": "They can’t break our memories, you know?",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4008_1001_1900_10": "Instead of a pendant, let’s just etch today’s\nmemories into our hearts!",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4008_1001_2000_10": "You’re right... Thanks, Hilda.",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4008_1001_2100_10": "It’s all so beautiful.",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4008_1001_2200_10": "But now it’s going to end.",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4008_1001_2300_10": "I wasn’t finished enjoying the festival...",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4008_1001_2400_10": "I think we already enjoyed it quite a bit.",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4008_1001_2500_10": "But I wanted to hang out with you two even more!",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4008_1001_2600_10": "It...really is beautiful.",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4008_1001_2700_10": "What was that, N?",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4008_1001_2800_10": "I’m sure today’s memories will live on forever in\nmy heart. That’s how beautiful this is.",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4008_1001_2900_10": "When you first invited me to the summer festival,\nI thought I should refuse because I didn’t\nreally know how to properly enjoy one.",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4008_1001_3000_10": "I felt guilty that I wouldn’t be able to truly enjoy it\nwith you.",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4008_1001_3100_10": "But both of you were so kind to me, Hilda and\nHilbert. I had a wonderful time with you tonight.",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4008_1001_3200_10": "That really was fun. Thank you for inviting me.",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4008_1001_3300_10": "I’ll never forget the moments we shared today.",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4008_1001_3400_10": "Same!",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4008_1001_3500_10": "I won’t either, N!",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4008_1001_3600_10": "And...I don’t want it to end with just tonight.",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4008_1001_3700_10": "I hope I can go to another summer festival again\nwith you two.",
    "episode_event_summer_2022/4008_1001_3800_10": "And we’ll make more memories just as fun as the\nones we made today.",
