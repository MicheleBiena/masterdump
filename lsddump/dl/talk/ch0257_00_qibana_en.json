    "ch0257_00_qibana/0101_0701_01_10": "Hey, [Name:PlayerNickname ]! I see you’re all\nfired up and ready to go again today!",
    "ch0257_00_qibana/0101_0701_02_10": "You’ve got all the force of a raging storm. Even\nI feel like I’m gonna get blown away!",
    "ch0257_00_qibana/7101_0701_01_10": "Don’t let changes in the weather faze you in\nbattle—no matter what happens!",
    "ch0257_00_qibana/7101_0701_02_10": "Trainers and their partner Pokémon work together\nas one, right?",
    "ch0257_00_qibana/7101_0701_03_10": "If a Trainer loses their cool over something, they\nmay end up losing a battle—even one that’s going\ntheir way!",
    "ch0257_00_qibana/7102_0701_01_10": "People really show their personality when they’re\nbeing photographed, don’t you think?",
    "ch0257_00_qibana/7102_0701_02_10": "Take Leon’s Charizard pose, for example, or\nNessa’s modeling photos.",
    "ch0257_00_qibana/7102_0701_03_10": "Maybe I need to think of a new pose for myself\nas well!",
    "ch0257_00_qibana/7103_0701_01_10": "Selfies are an important part of my style.",
    "ch0257_00_qibana/7103_0701_02_10": "I actually started taking them so I’d never forget\nthe sting of my defeats.",
    "ch0257_00_qibana/7103_0701_03_10": "But now when I take a perfect selfie, the feeling I\nget is just as good as when I pull off a brilliant\nmove in battle!",
    "ch0257_00_qibana/7104_0701_01_10": "With all these Trainers gathered on Pasio, there’s\nprobably someone here who’s stronger than Leon.",
    "ch0257_00_qibana/7104_0701_02_10": "But no matter how strong they are, I’ll beat them\nall and rise to the top!",
    "ch0257_00_qibana/7104_0701_03_10": "I’ll make sure everyone here on Pasio knows the\nname of the great Raihan!",
    "ch0257_00_qibana/7105_0701_01_10": "Hey, [Name:PlayerNickname ]. Do you have a\nrival that you feel like you just have to beat?",
    "ch0257_00_qibana/7105_0701_02_10": "A proper rival makes all your training sessions\nthat much better.",
    "ch0257_00_qibana/7105_0701_03_10": "There’s no shortage of rivals here for you to\ncompete against! You can all get better together!",
    "ch0257_00_qibana/1701_0701_01_10": "Oh, there you are. Here—a present from the\ngreat Raihan!",
    "ch0257_00_qibana/1701_0701_02_10": "Make good use of it to keep on getting stronger\nas a Trainer.",
    "ch0257_00_qibana/1701_0702_01_10": "Knowing when and where to use items is an\nimportant part of being a good Trainer!",
    "ch0257_00_qibana/2501_0701_01_10": "Gym Leader Raihan doesn’t simply control the\nweather. He also seeks two-on-two battles!",
    "ch0257_00_qibana/2501_0701_02_10": "But battles here on Pasio are different than they\nare back in Galar.",
    "ch0257_00_qibana/2501_0701_03_10": "I’m learning a lot from watching your\nbattling style.",
    "ch0257_00_qibana/2501_0702_01_10": "When it comes to team battles, being able to work\ntogether with other Trainers is important, right?",
    "ch0257_00_qibana/2501_0702_02_10": "Well, I fall in sync with you pretty easily, so I’m\nnot worried about us at all!",
    "ch0257_00_qibana/2511_0701_01_10": "Hey, what do you plan to do once you reach the\ntop here on Pasio?",
    "ch0257_00_qibana/2511_0701_02_10": "Me, I’m completely focused on taking down Leon.\nTraining for that is tons of fun. I’m not even\nthinking about what comes next after I beat him.",
    "ch0257_00_qibana/2511_0702_01_10": "What’s that? Even if I beat Leon, I still have to\nface you?",
    "ch0257_00_qibana/2511_0702_02_10": "Haha! I guess you’re right! Leon’s not the only\nsuperstrong Trainer out there!",
    "ch0257_00_qibana/2511_0702_03_10": "I like that cheek of yours! All right! Guess I’ve got\nanother day of hard training ahead of me today!",
    "ch0257_00_qibana/3001_0701_01_10": "You going out to train this early, mate? Hah!\nI knew you had massive potential as a Trainer,\nbut now you’re just flexing!",
    "ch0257_00_qibana/3003_0701_01_10": "Ah, the sun feels amazing today! Makes me feel\nlike I’m alive, y’know what I mean? And it really\nsets my battles on fire, too!",
    "ch0257_00_qibana/3005_0701_01_10": "A cool breeze at night feels amazing after a day\nof sweating on the battlefield, eh? We got some\ngood training in today, though!",
