    "episode_event_anniversary_2021/4001_1201_0200_10": "There’ve gotta be tons of sync pairs out there who\nwould jump at the opportunity to battle you, yeah!",
    "episode_event_anniversary_2021/4001_1201_0300_10": "I’ve already decided that I want you as my first\nopponent, Professor Kukui!",
    "episode_event_anniversary_2021/4001_1201_0400_10": "Though...now that you’re actually here...I’m\nfeeling kind of nervous!",
    "episode_event_anniversary_2021/4001_1201_0500_10": "Oh no—my sweet Lillie... This is her big moment!\nShould I do something to help?",
    "episode_event_anniversary_2021/4001_1201_0600_10": "We only have one job to do right now, and that’s\nto cheer them on with everything we’ve got!",
    "episode_event_anniversary_2021/4001_1201_0700_10": "You can do it, Lillie! Professor Kukui! We’re\nrooting for you!",
    "episode_event_anniversary_2021/4001_1201_0800_10": "Back in Alola, you helped me out more times than\nI could count, Professor Kukui.",
    "episode_event_anniversary_2021/4001_1201_0900_10": "I wouldn’t be who I am today if not for all of the\namazing people who supported me along the way.",
    "episode_event_anniversary_2021/4001_1201_1000_10": "This battle is for you—to show you all how truly\nthankful I am!",
    "episode_event_anniversary_2021/4001_1201_1100_10": "Come on out, Lunala!",
    "episode_event_anniversary_2021/4001_1201_1200_10": "Oho! You partnered up with the Legendary\nPokémon Lunala?!",
    "episode_event_anniversary_2021/4001_1201_1300_10": "Aw yeah, I’m into it! As for me...",
    "episode_event_anniversary_2021/4001_1201_1400_10": "I gotta go with my buddy Lycanroc!",
    "episode_event_anniversary_2021/4001_1201_1500_10": "Man, it makes me so happy to see how much you\nkids have grown!",
    "episode_event_anniversary_2021/4001_1201_1600_10": "I hope we can all keep working together to\nmake Alola— Nah...Pasio! No...",
    "episode_event_anniversary_2021/4001_1201_1700_10": "...the WORLD a more fun place to be!",
    "episode_event_anniversary_2021/4001_1201_1800_10": "Me too!",
    "episode_event_anniversary_2021/4001_1201_1900_10": "Hmph... You’ve gotten strong, Lillie.",
    "episode_event_anniversary_2021/4001_1201_2000_10": "You’re not just my little sister. You’re also\nmy rival!",
    "episode_event_anniversary_2021/4001_1201_2100_10": "Bring it on, Lillie!",
    "episode_event_anniversary_2021/4001_1201_2200_10": "I’ll show you my full power, Professor Kukui!",
    "episode_event_anniversary_2021/4001_1201_2300_10": "Lunala and I are coming at you with everything\nwe’ve got!",
    "episode_event_anniversary_2021/4002_1201_0100_10": "Brilliant match! What a great start!",
    "episode_event_anniversary_2021/4002_1201_0200_10": "Next up, we have N... Come, trust in the bond\nbetween you and your Pokémon, and show us all\na glorious victory!",
    "episode_event_anniversary_2021/4002_1201_0300_10": "But wait—before we move on to the match...",
    "episode_event_anniversary_2021/4002_1201_0400_10": "N, would you care to grace us with a speech?",
    "episode_event_anniversary_2021/4002_1201_0500_10": "A...speech?",
    "episode_event_anniversary_2021/4002_1201_0600_10": "The young master heard about your dream and\nwanted to support your message somehow.",
    "episode_event_anniversary_2021/4002_1201_0700_10": "It would please him greatly if you could share a\nfew words.",
    "episode_event_anniversary_2021/4002_1201_0800_10": "Well, uh... I’m not really accustomed to\ngiving speeches.",
    "episode_event_anniversary_2021/4002_1201_0900_10": "So...I suppose I’ll just speak from my heart.",
    "episode_event_anniversary_2021/4002_1201_1000_10": "Humans and Pokémon can form strong connections\ntogether. Aid one another. It’s why we make the\nbest partners.",
    "episode_event_anniversary_2021/4002_1201_1100_10": "But in order for that to happen, we have to\naccept ideas that are different from ours instead\nof shunning them.",
    "episode_event_anniversary_2021/4002_1201_1200_10": "Seeing Pokémon and Trainers form sync pairs,\nseeing how they find common ground with one\nanother and battle together in teams...",
    "episode_event_anniversary_2021/4002_1201_2900_10": "Pasio is about as close to my ideal as anywhere\ncan be.",
    "episode_event_anniversary_2021/4002_1201_1300_10": "But darkness still exists in this world, and reality\ncan be a harsh place to live in sometimes.",
    "episode_event_anniversary_2021/4002_1201_1400_10": "That is why today, I want all of you to turn to\nyour partner Pokémon and remind yourselves of\nthe irreplaceable bond you share!",
    "episode_event_anniversary_2021/4002_1201_1500_10": "Show your Pokémon your true, unwavering love!",
    "episode_event_anniversary_2021/4002_1201_1600_10": "If all of us can do that, I believe we can change\nthis world like a chemical reaction.",
    "episode_event_anniversary_2021/4002_1201_1700_10": "That takes care of that, then... Are you ready,\n[Name:PlayerNickname ]?",
    "episode_event_anniversary_2021/4002_1201_1800_10": "As you’ve already seen once today, we get to\nchoose our own opponents at the Unity Gala.",
    "episode_event_anniversary_2021/4002_1201_1900_10": "I’d like to use this battle to express how grateful\nI am to have met so many wonderful sync pairs\non Pasio.",
    "episode_event_anniversary_2021/4002_1201_2000_10": "So I’d like you to—",
    "episode_event_anniversary_2021/4002_1201_2100_10": "Hold up! I’m the one you wanna battle!",
    "episode_event_anniversary_2021/4002_1201_2200_10": "Hey, you can’t just jump the gun like that!\nN! Pick ME to be your opponent!",
    "episode_event_anniversary_2021/4002_1201_2300_10": "I’d love to battle you both, but I can’t exactly\nchoose between you...",
    "episode_event_anniversary_2021/4002_1201_2400_10": "Ah, I know! Why don’t have a double battle? You\ntwo against [Name:PlayerNickname ] and me.",
    "episode_event_anniversary_2021/4002_1201_2500_10": "I like the sound of that! Let’s do it, Hilbert!",
    "episode_event_anniversary_2021/4002_1201_2600_10": "All right! Look out, [Name:PlayerNickname ]!\nAnd you, too, N! We won’t go easy on you!",
    "episode_event_anniversary_2021/4002_1201_2700_10": "*chuckle* I’m glad we found a solution, even if it\nis a bit much.",
    "episode_event_anniversary_2021/4002_1201_2800_10": "Now then, let’s get this lovefest back on track!\nIt’s time to battle!",
    "episode_event_anniversary_2021/4003_1201_0100_10": "Now, Rayquaza!",
    "episode_event_anniversary_2021/4003_1201_0200_10": "Simply wonderful. You and Rayquaza are in\nperfect harmony with one another!",
    "episode_event_anniversary_2021/4003_1201_0300_10": "Well, I believe you deserve some credit for\nhelping me dissolve much of the mystery\nsurrounding Rayquaza.",
    "episode_event_anniversary_2021/4003_1201_0400_10": "Ah... Are you referring to Hoenn’s ancient lore\nand the Draconid people?",
    "episode_event_anniversary_2021/4003_1201_0500_10": "Indeed. Thanks to you, I gained a deeper\nunderstanding of Rayquaza. I chose to battle\nyou today to show you how much that’s paid off.",
    "episode_event_anniversary_2021/4003_1201_0600_10": "That’s all you, Steven. You’re the one who was\ncurious about the relationship between Mega\nEvolution and meteorites in the first place, right?",
    "episode_event_anniversary_2021/4003_1201_0700_10": "That’s true, I suppose...",
    "episode_event_anniversary_2021/4003_1201_0800_10": "I did battle a Rayquaza once before, though.",
    "episode_event_anniversary_2021/4003_1201_0900_10": "If not for the help of a certain formidable Trainer,\nI would have been in deep trouble.",
    "episode_event_anniversary_2021/4003_1201_1000_10": "That battle remains burned into my memory to\nthis day.",
    "episode_event_anniversary_2021/4003_1201_1100_10": "I can still see it clearly in my mind—that Trainer\nstanding defiantly before the might of Rayquaza.",
    "episode_event_anniversary_2021/4003_1201_1200_10": "Now that I’ve partnered up with this Rayquaza\nhere on Pasio...",
    "episode_event_anniversary_2021/4003_1201_1300_10": "I hope that the pair of us can grow strong enough\nto surpass him!",
    "episode_event_anniversary_2021/4003_1201_1400_10": "No wonder you were so focused on researching\nRayquaza back then.",
    "episode_event_anniversary_2021/4003_1201_1500_10": "Besides, there’s another Trainer on Pasio who’s\npartnered up with a Rayquaza.",
    "episode_event_anniversary_2021/4003_1201_1600_10": "I’d like to battle her someday, too.",
    "episode_event_anniversary_2021/4003_1201_1700_10": "And this time, I think I’ll be able to approach\na battle against Rayquaza a bit differently\nthan before.",
    "episode_event_anniversary_2021/4003_1201_1800_10": "You do hate to lose, don’t you, Steven.",
    "episode_event_anniversary_2021/4003_1201_1900_10": "If I’m going to battle, I’d obviously rather win\nthan lose!",
    "episode_event_anniversary_2021/4003_1201_2000_10": "Just like I intend to defeat you right now!",
    "episode_event_anniversary_2021/4003_1201_2100_10": "I won’t go down so easily! Prepare to be dazzled\nby my aquatic illusions!",
    "episode_event_anniversary_2021/4003_1201_2200_10": "Let’s do this, Rayquaza!",
