    "episode_event_specialcos02/4001_1001_0300_10": "Right, I’d heard that, too, but...",
    "episode_event_specialcos02/4001_1001_0400_10": "She really seems like an actual queen. I could\nlearn a thing or two from her!",
    "episode_event_specialcos02/4001_1001_0500_10": "Gwaaah?! But Antique Form Polteageist is right\nthere in front of me!",
    "episode_event_specialcos02/4001_1001_0600_10": "I’ll just have to try again with different Pokémon!",
    "episode_event_specialcos02/4001_1001_0700_10": "That’s enough! I’m afraid we won’t tolerate you\nbeing a nuisance!",
    "episode_event_specialcos02/4001_1001_0800_10": "Taking things from others is stealing! And we\nwon’t hold back against a thief!",

    "episode_event_specialcos02/4001_1001_1100_10": "I really thought I’d finally get a real Polteageist...",
    "episode_event_specialcos02/4001_1001_1200_10": "OK, that’s enough! You need to apologize!",
    "episode_event_specialcos02/4001_1001_1300_10": "Yes, it’s only natural that she’d be angry. You\ntried to steal her dear partner Pokémon.",
    "episode_event_specialcos02/4001_1001_1400_10": "I’m...sorry. Seeing something so rare, I just\ncouldn’t help myself.",
    "episode_event_specialcos02/4001_1001_1500_10": "No! It’s not me you need to apologize to!",
    "episode_event_specialcos02/4001_1001_1600_10": "Huh?",
    "episode_event_specialcos02/4001_1001_1700_10": "Tell your Polteageist that you’re sorry!",
    "episode_event_specialcos02/4001_1001_1800_10": "That Polteageist battled as hard as it could—and\nall for your sake.",
    "episode_event_specialcos02/4001_1001_1900_10": "But right in front of that loyal partner, all you can\ntalk about is Antique Form Polteageist!",
    "episode_event_specialcos02/4001_1001_2000_10": "Who cares if it’s the Antique Form or the\nPhony Form?",
    "episode_event_specialcos02/4001_1001_2100_10": "Phony Form or not, that Polteageist is yours, and\nthat’s what makes it authentic!",
    "episode_event_specialcos02/4001_1001_2200_10": "I... You mean...",
    "episode_event_specialcos02/4001_1001_2300_10": "How very like you, Lillie. What excellent words\nof wisdom.",
    "episode_event_specialcos02/4001_1001_2400_10": "Yes, you’re right. This partner of mine has traveled\nall over Pasio with me.",
    "episode_event_specialcos02/4001_1001_2500_10": "I’m sorry, Polteageist.",
    "episode_event_specialcos02/4001_1001_2600_10": "You’re the only real Polteageist for me. So please,\nkeep being my partner...",
    "episode_event_specialcos02/4001_1001_2700_10": "You mean you’ll forgive me? Thank you so much!",
    "episode_event_specialcos02/4002_1001_0100_10": "By the way, I had no idea that only Antique\nForm Polteageist had that mark!",
    "episode_event_specialcos02/4002_1001_0200_10": "That’s right, Ingo! Neither one of us knew that!",
    "episode_event_specialcos02/4002_1001_0300_10": "I didn’t know, either!",
    "episode_event_specialcos02/4002_1001_0400_10": "You didn’t, Lillie?",
    "episode_event_specialcos02/4002_1001_0500_10": "I knew it had a mark on the bottom, but I just\nassumed that all the others did, too.",
    "episode_event_specialcos02/4002_1001_0600_10": "I thought you knew how to tell them apart, Lillie.\nThat’s why I wouldn’t let you answer.",
    "episode_event_specialcos02/4002_1001_0700_10": "Oh, but I’m sure I would have known which is\nmine even without seeing the mark!",
    "episode_event_specialcos02/4002_1001_0800_10": "After all, it’s my partner Pokémon!",
    "episode_event_specialcos02/4002_1001_0900_10": "Hmm... As a researcher, I wonder about that.",
    "episode_event_specialcos02/4002_1001_1000_10": "Why don’t we test that, Lillie? Can you really tell\nyour partner apart from all the others?",
    "episode_event_specialcos02/4002_1001_1100_10": "Yes! I’m sure I can!",
    "episode_event_specialcos02/4002_1001_1200_10": "Wow... You didn’t even hesitate.",
    "episode_event_specialcos02/4002_1001_1300_10": "Bravo! There’s a real bond between you two\nfor sure!",
    "episode_event_specialcos02/4002_1001_1400_10": "Aww, you’re making me blush... Thank you!",
    "episode_event_specialcos02/4002_1001_1500_10": "Hmm... Polteageist is often seen as a pest, so it\nusually disguises itself as kitchenware...",
    "episode_event_specialcos02/4002_1001_1600_10": "But I think I can see why this one chose to show\nitself to Lillie.",
    "episode_event_specialcos02/4002_1001_1700_10": "But anyway, congratulations once again on\nsolving all our puzzles! And now, what we’ve all\nbeen waiting for...",
    "episode_event_specialcos02/4002_1001_1800_10": "An elegant, well-mannered tea party!",
    "episode_event_specialcos02/4002_1001_1900_10": "Tea and sweets await! Everyone smile!",
    "episode_event_specialcos02/4002_1001_2000_10": "Let’s enjoy every minute of this fabulous tea party!",
