    "charaepi_ch0131_00_citron/2301_1101_0200_20": "Heliolisk was watching Clemont with a\nworried expression...",
    "charaepi_ch0131_00_citron/2301_0301_0300_10": "Hello!",
    "charaepi_ch0131_00_citron/2301_0401_0400_10": "A-ah! H-h-hello!",
    "charaepi_ch0131_00_citron/2301_0302_0500_10": "What’re you doing?",
    "charaepi_ch0131_00_citron/2301_0402_0600_10": "A-ah! W-w-well, I’m just doing some research!",
    "charaepi_ch0131_00_citron/2301_1201_0700_10": "Oh! It's you, [Name:PlayerNickname ]!\nYou really startled me...",
    "charaepi_ch0131_00_citron/2301_1201_0800_10": "Sorry, Heliolisk. I was really in the zone for a\nwhile there.",
    "charaepi_ch0131_00_citron/2301_1201_0900_10": "I’ve been conducting some research during my stay\non Pasio.",
    "charaepi_ch0131_00_citron/2301_1201_1000_10": "I’m especially interested in the energy generated\nby sync stones. My curiosity knows no bounds!",
    "charaepi_ch0131_00_citron/2301_1201_1100_10": "Obviously, when you’re talking energy, the first\nthought has got to be electricity, right?",
    "charaepi_ch0131_00_citron/2301_1201_1200_10": "Electricity is produced and converted by many\ndifferent things.",
    "charaepi_ch0131_00_citron/2301_1201_1300_10": "For example, Heliolisk can take in sunlight and\nconvert it into electricity.",
    "charaepi_ch0131_00_citron/2301_1201_1400_10": "If there were a way to convert the energy from\nsync stones into electricity, it could really optimize\nPasio’s electrical generation!",
    "charaepi_ch0131_00_citron/2301_0301_1500_10": "Energy from sync stones?",
    "charaepi_ch0131_00_citron/2301_0401_1600_10": "That’s right! You might be using it without even\nrealizing it.",
    "charaepi_ch0131_00_citron/2301_0302_1700_10": "Electricity from sync stones?",
    "charaepi_ch0131_00_citron/2301_0402_1800_10": "Yes! I’m glad you asked.",
    "charaepi_ch0131_00_citron/2301_1201_1900_10": "The energy released from sync stones is created\nthrough the bonds Trainers have with their\npartner Pokémon.",
    "charaepi_ch0131_00_citron/2301_1201_2000_10": "Simply put, it’s creating energy through the power\nof our thoughts and emotions!",
    "charaepi_ch0131_00_citron/2301_1201_2100_10": "The bonds of friendship between people and\nPokémon can illuminate our homes.",
    "charaepi_ch0131_00_citron/2301_1201_2200_10": "What a wonderful thing, don’t you think?",
    "charaepi_ch0131_00_citron/2301_1201_2300_10": "Looks like Heliolisk feels the same way.",
    "charaepi_ch0131_00_citron/2301_1201_2400_10": "Actually, I’ve been working on an add-on for my\nPoryphone that can utilize the power of bonds...",
    "charaepi_ch0131_00_citron/2301_1201_2500_10": "I got so caught up in my work that I haven’t been\nable to explore Pasio much. *yawn*",
    "charaepi_ch0131_00_citron/2301_0301_2600_10": "Looks like Heliolisk wants you to rest.",
    "charaepi_ch0131_00_citron/2301_0401_2700_10": "Huh? Is that true, Heliolisk?",
    "charaepi_ch0131_00_citron/2301_0302_2800_10": "Heliolisk looks worried about you.",
    "charaepi_ch0131_00_citron/2301_0402_2900_10": "Huh? Is that true, Heliolisk?",
    "charaepi_ch0131_00_citron/2301_1201_3000_10": "Hehe... I have a pretty bad habit of going off on\nmy own and losing myself in my work.",
    "charaepi_ch0131_00_citron/2301_1201_3100_10": "But in both Pokémon battles and science,\ncollaboration leads to success.",
    "charaepi_ch0131_00_citron/2301_1201_3200_10": "Thank you, Heliolisk. I shouldn’t push myself so\nhard. And I should definitely get some rest.",
    "charaepi_ch0131_00_citron/2301_1201_3300_10": "Hey, I’ve got it! [Name:PlayerNickname ], why\ndon’t you help me test out my new prototype?",
    "charaepi_ch0131_00_citron/2301_1101_3400_20": "[Name:PlayerNickname ] agreed. [EN:Gen Ref=\"255\" M=\"He\" F=\"She\" ] tested the\nprototype while Clemont got some rest. Later,\nClemont took [EN:Gen Ref=\"255\" M=\"his\" F=\"her\" ] feedback and began tinkering.",
    "charaepi_ch0131_00_citron/2301_1101_3500_20": "And after only a short time, Clemont’s invention\nwas complete!",
    "charaepi_ch0131_00_citron/2301_1201_3600_10": "It’s finished!",
    "charaepi_ch0131_00_citron/2301_1201_3700_10": "I call it the “Light That Pulses Once in Reaction to\nSync Strength”!",
    "charaepi_ch0131_00_citron/2301_1201_3800_10": "All right then, it’s time to ACTIVATE!",
    "charaepi_ch0131_00_citron/2301_1201_3900_10": "Hmm, I see... Yes, it’s just as I predicted!",
    "charaepi_ch0131_00_citron/2301_0301_4000_10": "It only turns on once?",
    "charaepi_ch0131_00_citron/2301_0401_4100_10": "That’s right. It might’ve worked only once, but\neven that was very important!",
    "charaepi_ch0131_00_citron/2301_0302_4200_10": "That’s the light of our bonds!",
    "charaepi_ch0131_00_citron/2301_0402_4300_10": "Exactly! The future is now, thanks to this light!",
    "charaepi_ch0131_00_citron/2301_1201_4400_10": "There are so many mysteries surrounding sync\nstrength... Sure, all that happened in this test was \na single small light pulse, but...",
    "charaepi_ch0131_00_citron/2301_1201_4500_10": "with enough of those small lights, we could\ncombine them to create an enormous light that\ncould illuminate an entire city!",
    "charaepi_ch0131_00_citron/2301_1201_4600_10": "Thanks for all your help today! It’d make me really\nhappy if we could work together again sometime!",
    "charaepi_ch0131_00_citron/2301_1201_4700_10": "The world illuminated by the power of the\nbonds everyone shares...",
    "charaepi_ch0131_00_citron/2301_1201_4800_10": "That’s the future I’m working toward!",
