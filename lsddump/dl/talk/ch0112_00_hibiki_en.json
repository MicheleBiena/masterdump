    "ch0112_00_hibiki/2501_0701_02_10": "Well, let’s see...\nBattles and tournaments are definitely a lot of fun.\nBut if I were to give a single reason...",
    "ch0112_00_hibiki/2501_0701_03_10": "Because it’s fun to be with them!\nYou’re the same way, right?",
    "ch0112_00_hibiki/2501_0702_01_10": "I thought it over, and I realized you don’t need\na reason to spend time with your friends or\nwith Pokémon!",
    "ch0112_00_hibiki/2501_0702_02_10": "We need each other—that’s why we’re together.\nIt’s as simple as that!",
    "ch0112_00_hibiki/2511_0701_01_10": "Sometimes when I’m exploring the island...",

    "ch0112_00_hibiki/2511_0701_04_10": "Whenever I see something like that, it doesn’t\nmatter how tired I am from exploring!\nI get full of energy again!",
    "ch0112_00_hibiki/2511_0702_01_10": "Seeing all the best views on Pasio...",
    "ch0112_00_hibiki/2511_0702_02_10": "That might be a pretty good goal, too!",
    "ch0112_00_hibiki/3001_0701_01_10": "When I decide I wanna do something, I go for it!\nSometimes you just have to dive in!",
    "ch0112_00_hibiki/3002_0701_01_10": "Got my hat, my bangs look good...\nAll ready to go! Wanna go explore together?",
    "ch0112_00_hibiki/3003_0701_01_10": "*cheerful humming*\nWhen I’m walking and singing, I feel like I can\ncross entire mountains!",
