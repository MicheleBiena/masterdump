    "ch0027_00_natane/0101_0701_02_10": "If there’s a meadow full of flowers, I bet\nthat’d make Grass-type Pokémon happy!",
    "ch0027_00_natane/0601_0701_01_10": "You know, I’m from the Sinnoh region.\nWe have a myth there that this whole\nworld was created by a Pokémon.",
    "ch0027_00_natane/0601_0701_02_10": "I think it must have been a Grass-type Pokémon!",
    "ch0027_00_natane/0601_0701_03_10": "’Cause, y’know, \nI can believe what I want, right?",
    "ch0027_00_natane/0601_0702_01_10": "I really enjoy pondering the world that’s\nmentioned in the Sinnoh region’s myths.",
    "ch0027_00_natane/0601_0702_02_10": "If it really was a Grass-type Pokémon that\ncreated the world, I think that deity definitely\nliked rain.",
    "ch0027_00_natane/0601_0702_03_10": "I mean, it must have, right?\nI think it also really loved rich soil,\nfull of nutrients.",
    "ch0027_00_natane/0602_0701_01_10": "I wonder how they choose the plants to bring\nto an artificial island.",
    "ch0027_00_natane/0602_0701_02_10": "I guess they gather a bunch of plants from\nall over and then choose which ones to plant.",
    "ch0027_00_natane/0602_0701_03_10": "I want to see if any plants from the Sinnoh\nregion were chosen!",
    "ch0027_00_natane/0602_0702_01_10": "It just occurred to me that there might be plants\nfrom far away that we’ve never seen before.",
    "ch0027_00_natane/0602_0702_02_10": "I’m excited about the Pokémon battles, sure,\nbut I’m also really looking forward to seeing\nall the different plants on Pasio!",
    "ch0027_00_natane/0603_0701_01_10": "When it comes to Grass-type Pokémon, Roserade\nis really cool, but I love Turtwig, too!",
    "ch0027_00_natane/0603_0701_02_10": "Watching its adorable little face munch down on\nleaves—it just made me want to hug it and\nnever let go!",
    "ch0027_00_natane/0603_0701_03_10": "I was wondering if I should actually do that\nwhen Turtwig came to me on its own!",
    "ch0027_00_natane/0603_0701_04_10": "Ever since then, Turtwig has been \none of my very best friends!",
    "ch0027_00_natane/0603_0702_01_10": "There are certain times where you meet someone\nfor the first time but then your feelings connect\nas if a flower was blooming between you.",
    "ch0027_00_natane/0603_0702_02_10": "Don’t worry—I know you’ll have a miraculous\nmoment like that, too, someday!",
    "ch0027_00_natane/0604_0701_01_10": "My Roserade is so cute, I’d love to hug her, too,\nbut I can’t.",
    "ch0027_00_natane/0604_0701_02_10": "Her thorns have poison, so I’d be in a lot\nof trouble if I hugged her.",
    "ch0027_00_natane/0604_0701_03_10": "Still, I love her so much, someday I might not\nbe able to resist and give her a squeeze.",
    "ch0027_00_natane/0604_0702_01_10": "They say beautiful flowers have thorns, but\nto have poison on top of that...",
    "ch0027_00_natane/0604_0702_02_10": "I think Roserade needs to be less pretty! Not!",
    "ch0027_00_natane/0605_0701_01_10": "The Pokémon I like all have really distinct aromas.",
    "ch0027_00_natane/0605_0701_02_10": "But even then, their scent changes from day\nto day. I can even tell their mood by how\nthey smell that day!",
    "ch0027_00_natane/0605_0701_03_10": "It’s almost like I’m talking to them.\nIt makes me feel like we’re really connected,\neven if they don’t understand the words I use.",
    "ch0027_00_natane/0605_0701_04_10": "You know, I’m a little curious about your scent,\ntoo, [Name:PlayerNickname ]. Hee hee!",
    "ch0027_00_natane/0605_0702_01_10": "Any Pokémon will try to tell you what it’s\nfeeling, even if it can’t use words.\nEach Pokémon has its way of communicating.",
    "ch0027_00_natane/0605_0702_02_10": "I think a Trainer’s job is to understand how\ntheir Pokémon communicate!",
    "ch0027_00_natane/1701_0701_01_10": "Oh, there you are! I was looking for you!\nI wanted to give you this.",
    "ch0027_00_natane/1701_0701_02_10": "Just thought I’d share!\nHold on to it. I’m sure it’ll come in handy!",
    "ch0027_00_natane/1701_0702_01_10": "It’s the same in nature, you know?\nYou receive, then you give—it’s all a cycle.",
    "ch0027_00_natane/1701_0702_02_10": "Don’t you think it’s romantic?",
    "ch0027_00_natane/2501_0701_01_10": "So, I have a secret to tell.\nI didn’t come here just for the adventure.",
    "ch0027_00_natane/2501_0701_02_10": "I came because I also wanted to overcome\nmy fears.",
    "ch0027_00_natane/2501_0701_03_10": "I haven’t really been able to tell my friends\nthat I’m a bit of a coward, but...",
    "ch0027_00_natane/2501_0701_04_10": "I felt like if I told you, you’d help me out.",
    "ch0027_00_natane/2501_0702_01_10": "You see, I’m really, really scared of...ghosts.",
    "ch0027_00_natane/2501_0702_02_10": "So, I just can’t handle Ghost-type Pokémon.",
    "ch0027_00_natane/2511_0701_01_10": "Hey. Do you know the Pokémon Pumpkaboo\nand Phantump?",
    "ch0027_00_natane/2511_0701_02_10": "As you know, I really love Grass-type\nPokémon, but...",
    "ch0027_00_natane/2511_0701_03_10": "These two, they’re not just Grass type.\nThey’re also Ghost type!",
    "ch0027_00_natane/2511_0701_04_10": "I want to take care of them and cuddle them too,\nso I can get over my fear.",
    "ch0027_00_natane/2511_0702_01_10": "See, I think they’re cute. I really do.",
    "ch0027_00_natane/2511_0702_02_10": "But their movements and whatnot are a bit\ndifferent from normal Grass types, and they\nscare me a little.",
    "ch0027_00_natane/2511_0702_03_10": "Still, as a Grass-type Pokémon Trainer,\nI can’t just stay scared!\nSomeday I’ll be able to cuddle them!",
    "ch0027_00_natane/3001_0701_01_10": "Good morning! How’re you feeling?\nI’m always doing great!",
    "ch0027_00_natane/3002_0701_01_10": "Today is another day where we can give it\nour all! It helps to say it out loud, you know.",
    "ch0027_00_natane/3003_0701_01_10": "Hey there! Let’s keep having Pokémon battles\nand continue getting stronger!",
    "ch0027_00_natane/3004_0701_01_10": "We’re all set and ready to get going!\nLa la la la la la la!",
    "ch0027_00_natane/3005_0701_01_10": "Good evening! Adventuring at night is fun, too.\nI mean, I’m not s-scared of the dark or anything.",
    "ch0027_00_natane/3006_0701_01_10": "*yawn*\nI’m getting drowsy! I can’t help it, though—\nall the plants are asleep, too!",
