    "charaepi_ch0123_00_mizuki/2301_0401_3800_10": "Yeah! I’ll get to know Rowlet even better and\nfigure out how he greets everyone!",
    "charaepi_ch0123_00_mizuki/2301_0302_3900_10": "Maybe watch him more?",
    "charaepi_ch0123_00_mizuki/2301_0402_4000_10": "Yeah! I’ll get to know Rowlet even better and\nfigure out how he greets everyone!",
    "charaepi_ch0123_00_mizuki/2301_1201_4100_10": "Thanks for listening! And if you have your own\nspecial way of greeting people, let me know!",

    "charaepi_ch0123_00_mizuki/2311_1201_0300_10": "Wait...does that mean Pokémon battles in Alola\nare different, too?",
    "charaepi_ch0123_00_mizuki/2311_1201_0400_10": "I’d say they’re pretty normal, but... Oh, I know!",
    "charaepi_ch0123_00_mizuki/2311_1201_0500_10": "If you battle me, maybe it’ll help give you a better\nunderstanding of the trials!",

    "charaepi_ch0123_00_mizuki/2311_0101_0200_10": "OK! I’m going all out so I can learn what battles\nare like in Alola!",
    "charaepi_ch0123_00_mizuki/2311_0501_0100_10": "Ahaha! I guess they turned out to be the same old\nPokémon battles that we have!",
    "charaepi_ch0123_00_mizuki/2311_0501_0200_10": "Yup! But I had a lot of fun!",

    "charaepi_ch0123_00_mizuki/2311_0501_0500_10": "Let’s have a lot more battles, then!",
    "charaepi_ch0123_00_mizuki/2312_1201_0100_10": "Marvelous! This angle... This view!",
    "charaepi_ch0123_00_mizuki/2312_1201_0200_10": "Your partner Pokémon is looking very confident!",
