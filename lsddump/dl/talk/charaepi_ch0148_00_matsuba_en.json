    "charaepi_ch0148_00_matsuba/2301_1201_0900_10": "It’s something we practice often back at the\nEcruteak Gym. I just close my eyes and try to\nsense where he is.",
    "charaepi_ch0148_00_matsuba/2301_1201_1000_10": "It’s part of my training to become a truly powerful\nTrainer—the kind spoken of in Ecruteak’s tales\nof yore.",

    "charaepi_ch0148_00_matsuba/2301_0401_1400_10": "Yeah. Which might explain why I’ve always\nwanted to be more like Drifblim—just drifting\nwithout a care wherever the wind takes me.",
    "charaepi_ch0148_00_matsuba/2301_0302_1500_10": "Sounds pretty tough!",
    "charaepi_ch0148_00_matsuba/2301_0402_1600_10": "Yeah. Which might explain why I’ve always\nwanted to be more like Drifblim—just drifting\nwithout a care wherever the wind takes me.",

    "charaepi_ch0148_00_matsuba/2301_1201_1800_10": "But now, I can’t imagine being without him!",
    "charaepi_ch0148_00_matsuba/2301_0301_1900_10": "You two sure get along well!",
    "charaepi_ch0148_00_matsuba/2301_0401_2000_10": "We do! But I’m hoping we’ll grow even closer.",
    "charaepi_ch0148_00_matsuba/2301_0302_2100_10": "What a great pair you make!",
    "charaepi_ch0148_00_matsuba/2301_0402_2200_10": "Thanks! But I’m hoping we’ll grow even closer.",
    "charaepi_ch0148_00_matsuba/2301_1201_2300_10": "Back at my Gym, there are Pokémon that have\nbeen with me even longer than Drifblim has—like\nmy Gengar, for instance.",
    "charaepi_ch0148_00_matsuba/2301_1201_2400_10": "But I decided to enter the PML with Drifblim so\nwe could get to know each other better.",
    "charaepi_ch0148_00_matsuba/2301_1201_2500_10": "Coming to Pasio has given us the chance to\nmeet you and other interesting sync pairs, not\nto mention see whole new landscapes.",

    "charaepi_ch0148_00_matsuba/2301_1201_2800_10": "but on the other hand, there are some things you\ncan only see by being a Gym Leader and taking\non challengers!",
    "charaepi_ch0148_00_matsuba/2301_1201_2900_10": "In fact, I’d say there are pearls of wisdom\neverywhere that can steer you toward being\na true Trainer!",
    "charaepi_ch0148_00_matsuba/2301_1201_3000_10": "And not just in battle, but in everyday life, too!",
    "charaepi_ch0148_00_matsuba/2301_1201_3100_10": "I hope deepening my bond with Drifblim will help\nme find those pearls of wisdom!",

    "charaepi_ch0148_00_matsuba/2301_1201_3300_10": "I’ve been closely observing the bond you’ve\nformed with your partner Pokémon.",
    "charaepi_ch0148_00_matsuba/2301_1201_3400_10": "As a Gym Leader, I’d love to face you in a serious\nbattle someday.",
    "charaepi_ch0148_00_matsuba/2301_1201_3500_10": "I can’t wait for the day you finally come knocking\non the Ecruteak Gym’s door!",

    "charaepi_ch0148_00_matsuba/2301_0401_3700_10": "Excellent! When the time comes, I’ll meet you\nhead on with all my power!",
    "charaepi_ch0148_00_matsuba/2301_0302_3800_10": "Challenge accepted!",

    "charaepi_ch0148_00_matsuba/2301_1201_4100_10": "Well, what gives ME the energy to fly is...my\nyears of training and the experience I’ve gained\nfrom facing so many challengers!",
    "charaepi_ch0148_00_matsuba/2301_1201_4200_10": "When you’re ready to pit your experience against\nours, Drifblim and I will be waiting!",
