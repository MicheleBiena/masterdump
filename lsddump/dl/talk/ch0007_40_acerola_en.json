    "ch0007_40_acerola/1701_0702_01_10": "It’s not candy, but I thought you’d like it just\nthe same!",
    "ch0007_40_acerola/2501_0701_01_10": "I heard that a long time ago, there were people\nwho thought that a new day began when the\nsun went down.",

    "ch0007_40_acerola/2501_0701_04_10": "If you preferred nighttime, too, that would be\nthe best!",
    "ch0007_40_acerola/2501_0702_01_10": "Just think! Sunset wouldn’t mark the end of a\nday—it would mark the beginning!",
    "ch0007_40_acerola/2501_0702_02_10": "Wouldn’t that be great? We could hang out\ntogether even more after the sun goes down!",
    "ch0007_40_acerola/2511_0701_01_10": "Wow, I’m a little shocked!",
    "ch0007_40_acerola/2511_0701_02_10": "My Mimikyu is usually really shy and reserved\naround others...",
    "ch0007_40_acerola/2511_0701_03_10": "but when he’s battling alongside your Pokémon,\nhe looks like he’s having so much fun!",
