    "ch0241_00_kojiro/0602_0701_03_10": "She just kept going on about some guy in another\nregion who’ll give your Pokémon special training\nin exchange for silver or gold bottle caps.",

    "ch0241_00_kojiro/3002_0701_01_10": "Have you eaten breakfast yet? *sigh*\nI wonder if there’s a donut shop on Pasio...\nI’m so hungry, I could eat more than a Snorlax.",
    "ch0241_00_kojiro/3002_0701_02_10": "Me too, but our budget’s been cut ’cause we\nmess up so much, remember? Now we can’t\neven afford donut holes!",
    "ch0241_00_kojiro/3003_0701_01_10": "My clever plan to capture all the Pokémon\non Pasio is almost comple— *cough cough* Oh!\nIs the café selling ice cream now?! Gotta run!",
