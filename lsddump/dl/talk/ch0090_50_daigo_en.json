    "ch0090_50_daigo/7101_0701_02_10": "Come on, let’s enjoy the day together!",
    "ch0090_50_daigo/7102_0701_01_10": "What do you and your Pokémon do when you\ncome across a really big obstacle?",
    "ch0090_50_daigo/7102_0701_02_10": "Rayquaza and I can simply soar right over it.",
    "ch0090_50_daigo/7102_0701_03_10": "But using brute strength to smash through it or\ncircumnavigating it altogether are also perfectly\ngood options.",
    "ch0090_50_daigo/7102_0701_04_10": "There’s always more than one way to do things.",
    "ch0090_50_daigo/7103_0701_01_10": "My partner Rayquaza is such a fascinating\nPokémon. Did you know it likes to eat meteorites?",

    "ch0090_50_daigo/2501_0701_04_10": "Every stone you see has a reason for being there.",
    "ch0090_50_daigo/2501_0702_01_10": "It takes a long time for a stone to become what\nit is, just like it takes time for us to grow and\nbecome stronger.",
    "ch0090_50_daigo/2501_0702_02_10": "I hope you and your Pokémon continue to deepen\nyour bond together as you grow on your journey.",
    "ch0090_50_daigo/2511_0701_01_10": "Standing at the very top can often feel like a\nbattle with yourself...",
    "ch0090_50_daigo/2511_0701_02_10": "so I’m glad I get the opportunity to battle talented\nsync pairs like you and your partner.",
    "ch0090_50_daigo/2511_0701_03_10": "It lets me feel that drive to aim even higher—\nto feel the bond I’ve developed with my own\npartner Pokémon.",
