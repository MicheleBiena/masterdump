    "legend_event_pm0873_00_sun/5005_1001_0800_10": "What if it came here alone from someplace far\naway, to devour the sun like the legends say...?",

    "legend_event_pm0873_00_sun/5005_1001_1100_10": "Hang on—there shouldn’t be any wild Pokémon\non Pasio! They must have come with Solgaleo.",
    "legend_event_pm0873_00_sun/5005_0301_1200_10": "They almost look like...a team.",
    "legend_event_pm0873_00_sun/5005_0401_1300_10": "Whoa, you’re right! They must be friends.",
    "legend_event_pm0873_00_sun/5005_0302_1400_10": "Maybe they’re friends?",
    "legend_event_pm0873_00_sun/5005_0402_1500_10": "Maybe... They almost look like they could be\na team.",
    "legend_event_pm0873_00_sun/5005_1001_1600_10": "Uh, maybe it’s just my imagination...",
    "legend_event_pm0873_00_sun/5005_1001_1700_10": "but it looks like Solgaleo wants to battle all the\nsync pairs gathered up here right now.",
    "legend_event_pm0873_00_sun/5005_1001_1800_10": "Hah! If this Solgaleo doesn’t have a Trainer...",
    "legend_event_pm0873_00_sun/5005_1001_1900_10": "I’ll take it down and form a sync pair with\nit myself!",
    "legend_event_pm0873_00_sun/5005_1001_2000_10": "C’mon, sunshine! Let’s fight!\nYou’re lookin’ at your new master, right here!",
    "legend_event_pm0873_00_sun/5005_1001_2100_10": "Whoa, Solgaleo looks like it’s ready to pounce!",
    "legend_event_pm0873_00_sun/5005_1001_2200_10": "You say that like it’s a bad thing! Watch this, kid.\nI’ll show ya how it’s done!",
    "legend_event_pm0873_00_sun/5005_1001_2300_10": "Count me in! This is gonna be the most epic\nbattle ever!",
    "legend_event_pm0873_00_sun/5005_1001_2400_10": "Hold it! Legendary Pokémon or not, it’s not right\nto gang up on Pokémon like that.",
    "legend_event_pm0873_00_sun/5005_1001_2500_10": "Haha! Are you serious? I mean, look at it—\nit’s practically taunting us all!",
    "legend_event_pm0873_00_sun/5005_1001_2600_10": "Come on, Solgaleo! It’s time to battle!",
    "legend_event_pm0873_00_sun/5005_1001_2700_10": "Th-that thing’s a beast... We’re no match at all\nfor a Legendary Pokémon that strong...",
    "legend_event_pm0873_00_sun/5005_1001_2800_10": "Guess that’s why we call ’em Legendary...\nLook! Solgaleo just crushed all those Trainers,\nand it’s barely breakin’ a sweat.",
    "legend_event_pm0873_00_sun/5005_1001_2900_10": "Wahh! Why’s it looking at us?!\nDo you think it wants to battle us next?",
    "legend_event_pm0873_00_sun/5005_1001_3000_10": "Heh, it’s about time! I’ve been wonderin’ when\nit’d finally be our turn to take the stage!",
    "legend_event_pm0873_00_sun/5005_1001_3100_10": "C’mon, [Name:PlayerNickname ]!\nLet’s show this Legendary Pokémon\nhow we rock ’n’ roll!",
    "legend_event_pm0873_00_sun/5006_1001_0100_10": "That roar... I think that might be Solgaleo’s way\nof acknowledging our victory!",
    "legend_event_pm0873_00_sun/5006_1001_0200_10": "How do you feel, Solgaleo! I bet the fire in our\nhearts got yours beatin’ like a drum!",
    "legend_event_pm0873_00_sun/5006_1001_0300_10": "Huh. Is it just me, or does Solgaleo look a little\ntoo cheerful for having just lost?",
    "legend_event_pm0873_00_sun/5006_1001_0400_10": "Maybe it had a ton of fun battling us, so we\nmade it really happy!",
    "legend_event_pm0873_00_sun/5006_1001_0500_10": "That’s my theory. Solgaleo probably loves having\nfun whenever it battles, just like us.",
    "legend_event_pm0873_00_sun/5006_1101_0600_20": "As if in answer to Solgaleo’s valiant roar,\na cool, refreshing breeze swept across the\nmountain peak with the morning sun...",
    "legend_event_pm0873_00_sun/5006_1001_0700_10": "Wow, can you feel that breeze? The sunshine’s\nso nice up here, I don’t even feel tired anymore!",
    "legend_event_pm0873_00_sun/5006_1001_0800_10": "Um... Am I goin’ crazy, or is Solgaleo givin’ off\nan even more intense vibe now?",
    "legend_event_pm0873_00_sun/5006_1001_0900_10": "Whoa, you’re right! Maybe it got its energy back\nafter eating up all that sunshine!",
    "legend_event_pm0873_00_sun/5006_1001_1000_10": "It looks like it wants to battle again.",
    "legend_event_pm0873_00_sun/5006_1001_1100_10": "That’s what I was thinkin’! Feels like it’s tryin’ to\npump us up for another round!",
    "legend_event_pm0873_00_sun/5006_1001_1200_10": "Yeah, I get the feeling Solgaleo doesn’t like\nto lose. It wants to prove it can beat us!",
    "legend_event_pm0873_00_sun/5006_1001_1300_10": "Hehe, fine by me. You’ve got some guts, Solgaleo!\nI like your style! ",
    "legend_event_pm0873_00_sun/5006_1001_1400_10": "If you want more where that came from,\nthen c’mon! Let’s battle it out till we forget\nour own names!",
    "legend_event_pm0873_00_sun/5006_1001_1500_10": "Get ready, ’cause we’re about to blow your mind!",
    "legend_event_pm0873_00_sun/5007_1001_0100_10": "Phew...\nHow many battles is that now? I lost count...",
    "legend_event_pm0873_00_sun/5007_1001_0200_10": "Not a...clue...\nI’ve barely had a...moment to breathe...",
    "legend_event_pm0873_00_sun/5007_1001_0300_10": "That team must be crazy. After our battle,\nwe were so exhausted that we could barely stand.",
    "legend_event_pm0873_00_sun/5007_1001_0400_10": "I know, right? But what’s even crazier is...",
    "legend_event_pm0873_00_sun/5007_1001_0500_10": "That Solgaleo, right? It’s duked it out with every\nsingle sync pair here... That’s just crazy!",
    "legend_event_pm0873_00_sun/5007_1001_0600_10": "It looks like it might finally be satisfied.",
    "legend_event_pm0873_00_sun/5007_1001_0700_10": "Hehe... Think our poisonous riffs satisfied its\nthirst for battle?",
    "legend_event_pm0873_00_sun/5007_1001_0800_10": "I’ve been jammin’ out so hard, I forgot to watch\nthe rest of the sunrise. Guess that means it was\nworth it!",
    "legend_event_pm0873_00_sun/5007_1001_0900_10": "Huh, now that you mention it, I think I forgot, too.",
    "legend_event_pm0873_00_sun/5007_1001_1000_10": "But the Pokémon that devours the sun arrived\nright along with it, right? So it’s kind of like we\ngot to see both!",
    "legend_event_pm0873_00_sun/5007_1001_1100_10": "Haha, I guess it’s true when you put it that way!",
    "legend_event_pm0873_00_sun/5007_1001_1200_10": "Man, nothin’ beats gettin’ to have such a rad\nsession with Solgaleo, though! Kinda feels\nauspicious, like Professor Bellis was sayin’!",
    "legend_event_pm0873_00_sun/5007_1001_1300_10": "Speakin’ of which, we should probably start\nheadin’ back soon, now that the sun’s up...",
    "legend_event_pm0873_00_sun/5007_1001_1400_10": "Catch ya later, Solgaleo. Stay cool.",
    "legend_event_pm0873_00_sun/5007_1001_1500_10": "Alola! Hope we can battle again sometime!",
    "legend_event_pm0873_00_sun/5007_1001_1600_10": "Hey, wait a sec... Is it just me, or is Solgaleo\nfollowin’ us?",
    "legend_event_pm0873_00_sun/5007_1001_1700_10": "Uhh...nope. It’s definitely not just you...\nIt looks like it’s...",
    "legend_event_pm0873_00_sun/5007_1001_1800_10": "Haha! I thought so! [Name:PlayerNickname ]...\nI think Solgaleo wants to be your partner!",
    "legend_event_pm0873_00_sun/5007_1001_1900_10": "Isn’t that right, Solgaleo?",
    "legend_event_pm0873_00_sun/5007_1001_2000_10": "I guess I’d be cool with you and Solgaleo\nforming a sync pair.",
    "legend_event_pm0873_00_sun/5007_1001_2100_10": "Yo, your battle skills were top-notch earlier!\nIf anyone deserves to team up with Solgaleo,\nit’s you, kid!",
    "legend_event_pm0873_00_sun/5007_1001_2200_10": "You heard ’em. So, what do you say,\n[Name:PlayerNickname ]?",
    "legend_event_pm0873_00_sun/5007_0301_2300_10": "Welcome to the team, Solgaleo!",
    "legend_event_pm0873_00_sun/5007_0401_2400_10": "Haha! I’m guessing that means it’s happy!",
    "legend_event_pm0873_00_sun/5007_0302_2500_10": "Guess I’ve got a new best friend!",
    "legend_event_pm0873_00_sun/5007_0402_2600_10": "You bet you do! Haha! You and Solgaleo are\ngonna make an awesome sync pair!",
    "legend_event_pm0873_00_sun/5007_1001_2700_10": "Woo-hoo! Now we’ll get to hang out with\nSolgaleo whenever we want!",
    "legend_event_pm0873_00_sun/5007_1001_2800_10": "Oh man! I hadn’t even thought of that! Hope we\nget to battle again sometime soon, Solgaleo!",
    "legend_event_pm0873_00_sun/5007_1001_2900_10": "Next time, as teammates!",
    "legend_event_pm0873_00_sun/5301_1001_0100_10": "Huh? Did those goons just teleport another sync\npair to Pasio? I guess I should go welcome\nwhoever it is...",
    "legend_event_pm0873_00_sun/5301_1001_0200_10": "Whoa... Uhh, OK. Wow. Is that Pokémon what I\nthink it is? Uhh, Team Break definitely upped their\ngame this time!",
    "legend_event_pm0873_00_sun/5301_1001_0300_10": "M-maybe this’ll be a good thing... More for\npeople to celebrate, right? I mean, as long as\nit’ll help us stir up some excitement, right?",
