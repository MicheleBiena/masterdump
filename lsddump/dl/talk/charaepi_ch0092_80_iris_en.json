    "charaepi_ch0092_80_iris/2301_0401_2400_10": "I said no way, of course!",
    "charaepi_ch0092_80_iris/2301_0302_2500_10": "But you didn’t give up, did you.",
    "charaepi_ch0092_80_iris/2301_0402_2600_10": "*chuckle* Exactly! ",

    "charaepi_ch0092_80_iris/2301_1201_2800_10": "So it took some time, but I talked to Hydreigon a\nlot...and that’s how we became friends with\neach other!",
