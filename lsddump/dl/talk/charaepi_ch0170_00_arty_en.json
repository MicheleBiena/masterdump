    "charaepi_ch0170_00_arty/2301_1201_0200_10": "And just look at that incredible patterning on its\nantennae! I feel like it’s staring straight into\nmy soul!",
    "charaepi_ch0170_00_arty/2301_0301_0300_10": "What’s all the excitement about?",
    "charaepi_ch0170_00_arty/2301_0401_0400_10": "Ooh! Look who fluttered by for a visit!\nI didn’t expect to run into you today,\n[Name:PlayerNickname ].",
    "charaepi_ch0170_00_arty/2301_0302_0500_10": "You seem to be enjoying yourself.",

    "charaepi_ch0170_00_arty/2301_1201_0800_10": "Turns out he’s been buzzing for me to take a\nlook at his partner!",
    "charaepi_ch0170_00_arty/2301_1201_0900_10": "How could I say no to that? Getting to closely\nobserve such cute Pokémon is probably just as\nfun for me as it is for them.",
    "charaepi_ch0170_00_arty/2301_0301_1000_10": "Did it give you some inspiration?",
    "charaepi_ch0170_00_arty/2301_0401_1100_10": "Oh, absolutely! I got to observe a Beautifly a\nminute ago that had the most adorably shaped\nmouth I’ve seen in a long time.",
    "charaepi_ch0170_00_arty/2301_0302_1200_10": "Any cool discoveries?",
    "charaepi_ch0170_00_arty/2301_0402_1300_10": "Oh, absolutely! The Beautifly I looked at a minute\nago had the most adorably shaped proboscis I’ve\nseen in a long time.",
    "charaepi_ch0170_00_arty/2301_1201_1400_10": "It had an elegant but cute little curl to it...like\na swirl. I reached out to see what it would feel\nlike and...",
    "charaepi_ch0170_00_arty/2301_1201_4700_10": "PLINK! Jabbed me right in the hand.",
    "charaepi_ch0170_00_arty/2301_1201_1500_10": "Ahaha! Maybe it thought I was trying to taunt it\nsomehow. Who knows? It was obviously bugged\nby my presence.",
    "charaepi_ch0170_00_arty/2301_1201_1600_10": "Anyway, it was an interesting experience to say\nthe least! Even the painful part.",
    "charaepi_ch0170_00_arty/2301_1201_1700_10": "Just don’t go getting any ideas, all right? Even\nBeautifly can be dangerous if angered, and I\ndon’t want you getting hurt.",
    "charaepi_ch0170_00_arty/2301_1201_1800_10": "That reminds me... At some point, I met a Trainer\nhere on Pasio who had a Spinarak for a partner.",
    "charaepi_ch0170_00_arty/2301_1201_1900_10": "For whatever reason, I decided to have a staring\ncontest with the pattern on its back. I thought it\nwould be fun to see who cracked a smile first.",
    "charaepi_ch0170_00_arty/2301_1201_2000_10": "Did you know that Spinarak can change their\npatterns depending on their mood?",
    "charaepi_ch0170_00_arty/2301_1201_2100_10": "Well, when I won the staring contest, this one’s\nback pattern went from a smiley face to a\nsad face.",
    "charaepi_ch0170_00_arty/2301_0301_2200_10": "How do you know all of this stuff?!",
    "charaepi_ch0170_00_arty/2301_0401_2300_10": "Because I looove Bug Pokémon! Every time I\ndiscover something new about them, I just want\nto learn more!",
    "charaepi_ch0170_00_arty/2301_0302_2400_10": "I don’t know if I would have noticed!",
    "charaepi_ch0170_00_arty/2301_0402_2500_10": "Really? Oh! I know! Why don’t you try observing\nsome Bug Pokémon with me now? I can give you\nsome pointers!",
    "charaepi_ch0170_00_arty/2301_1201_2600_10": "Tip number one is unequivocally...love!",
    "charaepi_ch0170_00_arty/2301_1201_2700_10": "Here, I’ll show you...",
    "charaepi_ch0170_00_arty/2301_1201_2800_10": "Yes! Right there! Come out from your hiding spot,\nlittle one!",
    "charaepi_ch0170_00_arty/2301_1201_2900_10": "Ooh! I know you! Aren’t you the Spinarak I had a\nstaring contest with before?",
    "charaepi_ch0170_00_arty/2301_1201_3000_10": "I wonder if it came looking for me, hoping we\ncould play another round.",
    "charaepi_ch0170_00_arty/2301_0301_3100_10": "How did you know it was there?",
    "charaepi_ch0170_00_arty/2301_0401_3200_10": "It was actually Leavanny that noticed it.",
    "charaepi_ch0170_00_arty/2301_0302_3300_10": "Good eye!",
    "charaepi_ch0170_00_arty/2301_0402_3400_10": "Well, it was actually Leavanny that noticed it.",
    "charaepi_ch0170_00_arty/2301_1201_3500_10": "Leavanny are incredibly nurturing Pokémon\nby nature.",
    "charaepi_ch0170_00_arty/2301_1201_3600_10": "When mine finds small Pokémon, he likes to weave\nclothing for them from leaves using the sticky silk\nhe secretes from his mouth.",
    "charaepi_ch0170_00_arty/2301_1201_3700_10": "So when I saw him start to fidget, I knew there\nmust be a little one around here somewhere.",
    "charaepi_ch0170_00_arty/2301_0301_3800_10": "I didn’t notice at all!",
    "charaepi_ch0170_00_arty/2301_0401_3900_10": "Hehe! Well, when it comes to my beloved partner,\nI’m just extra attentive.",
    "charaepi_ch0170_00_arty/2301_0302_4000_10": "You really know your bugs, Burgh!",
    "charaepi_ch0170_00_arty/2301_0402_4100_10": "Hehe! Well, when it comes to my beloved partner,\nI’m just extra attentive.",
    "charaepi_ch0170_00_arty/2301_1201_4200_10": "When you’re really close to a Pokémon, you start\nto understand what it’s thinking by the way it\nmoves or by the way its cries sound.",
    "charaepi_ch0170_00_arty/2301_1201_4300_10": "No matter how much I observe other people’s\nBug Pokémon...",
    "charaepi_ch0170_00_arty/2301_1201_4400_10": "Leavanny will always be the most adorable\nPokémon in my eyes.",
    "charaepi_ch0170_00_arty/2301_1201_4500_10": "Now, then! Why don’t we go and find this little\nSpinarak’s Trainer? I’m sure he’s around\nhere somewhere.",
    "charaepi_ch0170_00_arty/2301_1201_4600_10": "Come on! Let’s do it together!",
