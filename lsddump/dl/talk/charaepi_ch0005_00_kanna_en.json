    "charaepi_ch0005_00_kanna/2301_1101_0300_20": "and found Lorelei and Lapras \nstanding on the beach.",
    "charaepi_ch0005_00_kanna/2301_1201_0400_10": "Oh, [Name:PlayerNickname ].\nI didn’t expect to see you here.",
    "charaepi_ch0005_00_kanna/2301_1201_0500_10": "Lapras and I were just taking a joyride on\nthe ocean.",
    "charaepi_ch0005_00_kanna/2301_0301_0600_10": "That sounds really relaxing.",
    "charaepi_ch0005_00_kanna/2301_0401_0700_10": "It is. Pasio has beautiful oceans around it.\nJust floating on the ocean is very pleasant.",
    "charaepi_ch0005_00_kanna/2301_0302_0800_10": "Don’t you get motion sickness?",
    "charaepi_ch0005_00_kanna/2301_0402_0900_10": "Not at all. Lapras is very comfortable to ride on.",
    "charaepi_ch0005_00_kanna/2301_0402_1000_10": "Not only that—Pasio’s waters are so calm,\nI can’t imagine getting sick at all.",
    "charaepi_ch0005_00_kanna/2301_1201_1100_10": "And in case you were wondering, Lapras like to\nswim with people riding on their backs.",

    "charaepi_ch0005_00_kanna/2301_0401_1400_10": "I guess that was unnecessary. You seem to\nunderstand what’s important as a Trainer.",
    "charaepi_ch0005_00_kanna/2301_0302_1500_10": "Oh, really? I didn’t know that!",
    "charaepi_ch0005_00_kanna/2301_0402_1600_10": "Oh, stop joking. I know you’re the kind \nof Trainer who always thinks about \nyour Pokémon first and foremost.",
    "charaepi_ch0005_00_kanna/2301_0402_1700_10": "I can tell just by looking at you.",

    "charaepi_ch0005_00_kanna/2301_1201_2000_10": "But the truth is that these Pokémon stay \nwith us because they trust us, \nand those people have forgotten that.",
    "charaepi_ch0005_00_kanna/2301_1201_2100_10": "Our Pokémon are our friends, and our friends\nare our equals.",
    "charaepi_ch0005_00_kanna/2301_0301_2200_10": "Of course.",

    "charaepi_ch0005_00_kanna/2301_1201_2800_10": "All in all, I think it’s kindhearted Trainers like\nyou who are going to rise to the top of the PML.",
    "charaepi_ch0005_00_kanna/2301_1201_2900_10": "At least, I hope that’s the case! That being said,\nI have every intention of winning myself.",
    "charaepi_ch0005_00_kanna/2301_1201_3000_10": "Hm? You want to go for another swim, Lapras?\nReally, what am I going to do with you...",
    "charaepi_ch0005_00_kanna/2301_1201_3100_10": "Well, last time I was the one who suggested\nwe go out...",
    "charaepi_ch0005_00_kanna/2301_1201_3200_10": "I suppose it’s only fair that we go out again if\nthat’s what Lapras wants.",
