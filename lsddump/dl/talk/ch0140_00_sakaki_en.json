    "ch0140_00_sakaki/0601_0701_02_10": "I’m the same way. If you don’t maintain your\ntools, they don’t last as long. They start to lose\ntheir strength after a while.",

    "ch0140_00_sakaki/0603_0701_01_10": "I’m a mean old man. I could be lying and\ndeceiving you right now, and you wouldn’t\neven know it.",

    "ch0140_00_sakaki/2501_0701_02_10": "And by profit, I mean money. When it comes to\nbusiness, there’s no room for things like friendship\nor caring for one another.",
    "ch0140_00_sakaki/2501_0701_03_10": "I understand where you’re coming from, though.\nI can appreciate your viewpoint.",
