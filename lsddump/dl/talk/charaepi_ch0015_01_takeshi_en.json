    "charaepi_ch0015_01_takeshi/2301_1201_0200_10": "Now, I want an honest answer.\nDo you think this outfit suits me?",
    "charaepi_ch0015_01_takeshi/2301_0301_0300_10": "Yeah.",
    "charaepi_ch0015_01_takeshi/2301_0401_0400_10": "I’m glad to hear you think so, too.",
    "charaepi_ch0015_01_takeshi/2301_0302_0500_10": "Well, it’s not bad...",
    "charaepi_ch0015_01_takeshi/2301_0402_0600_10": "Hm. When you say “not bad,” that means \nthat it’s somewhat becoming, right?",
    "charaepi_ch0015_01_takeshi/2301_1201_0700_10": "I’m rather fond of this suit myself.",
    "charaepi_ch0015_01_takeshi/2301_1201_0800_10": "But...I also kind of feel it’s a little...too much.",
    "charaepi_ch0015_01_takeshi/2301_1201_0900_10": "While I do like it, it’s a little \nembarrassing at the same time.",
    "charaepi_ch0015_01_takeshi/2301_0301_1000_10": "You look like Tyranitar.",
    "charaepi_ch0015_01_takeshi/2301_0401_1100_10": "Ah, you noticed, too!",
    "charaepi_ch0015_01_takeshi/2301_0302_1200_10": "You look like a Pokémon.",
    "charaepi_ch0015_01_takeshi/2301_0402_1300_10": "Ah, you noticed, too!",
    "charaepi_ch0015_01_takeshi/2301_1201_1400_10": "Apparently, this sygna suit was designed to give\nTrainers a stronger connection to their Pokémon.",
    "charaepi_ch0015_01_takeshi/2301_1201_1500_10": "I’m not familiar with fashion, \nbut some so-called famous designer \nwas very insistent that I wear this suit.",
    "charaepi_ch0015_01_takeshi/2301_1201_1600_10": "And here’s the weird thing: when I’m wearing\nthis outfit, I feel like I’ve become Tyranitar.",
    "charaepi_ch0015_01_takeshi/2301_1201_1700_10": "I’ve been training with Tyranitar for a \nwhile now. I would trust him with my life.",
    "charaepi_ch0015_01_takeshi/2301_1201_1800_10": "And before I started wearing this suit, \nI thought we perfectly understood each other.",
    "charaepi_ch0015_01_takeshi/2301_1201_1900_10": "But once I put on this outfit...",
    "charaepi_ch0015_01_takeshi/2301_1201_2000_10": "I feel like I can feel the same things he does.\nLike I know exactly what he wants me to do\nwith incredible clarity.",
    "charaepi_ch0015_01_takeshi/2301_1201_2100_10": "At least that’s how it feels.",
    "charaepi_ch0015_01_takeshi/2301_1201_2200_10": "If I can focus on honing this sensation \nto perfection, Tyranitar and I should be \nable to reach new heights!",
    "charaepi_ch0015_01_takeshi/2301_1201_2300_10": "This sygna suit made me feel the possibility\nof becoming even closer to my Pokémon.",
    "charaepi_ch0015_01_takeshi/2301_0301_2400_10": "That suit seems pretty cool.",
    "charaepi_ch0015_01_takeshi/2301_0401_2500_10": "As a fellow Trainer, I agree.",
    "charaepi_ch0015_01_takeshi/2301_0302_2600_10": "I want to wear it, too!",
    "charaepi_ch0015_01_takeshi/2301_0402_2700_10": "As a fellow Trainer, I can understand\nthe sentiment.",
    "charaepi_ch0015_01_takeshi/2301_1201_2800_10": "Tyranitar is known as the Armor Pokémon.",
    "charaepi_ch0015_01_takeshi/2301_1201_2900_10": "This sygna suit is my armor! Now, Tyranitar\nand I can fight even closer than ever!",
    "charaepi_ch0015_01_takeshi/2301_1201_3000_10": "Listen up, [Name:PlayerNickname ]!",
    "charaepi_ch0015_01_takeshi/2301_1201_3100_10": "Now that I have this sygna suit, don’t think \nwe are the same as we were before.\nWe are stronger than you could imagine!",
