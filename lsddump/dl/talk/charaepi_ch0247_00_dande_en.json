    "charaepi_ch0247_00_dande/2301_1201_0300_10": "Hang in there, Metagross!",
    "charaepi_ch0247_00_dande/2301_1201_0400_10": "Whoa! What an intense battle!",
    "charaepi_ch0247_00_dande/2301_1201_0500_10": "It might cause a rockslide! Watch out!",
    "charaepi_ch0247_00_dande/2301_1201_0600_10": "I guess if we keep this up, we might cause some\nproblems for these people. Should we continue\nthis another day?",

    "charaepi_ch0247_00_dande/2301_0302_2300_10": "I wanna battle, too!",
    "charaepi_ch0247_00_dande/2301_0402_2400_10": "That’s what I like to hear! Let’s do it!",

    "charaepi_ch0247_00_dande/2301_1201_2600_10": "What’s wrong, Charizard? You don’t look\ntoo happy.",
