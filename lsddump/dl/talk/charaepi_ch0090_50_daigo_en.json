    "charaepi_ch0090_50_daigo/2301_1201_0900_10": "Did you know that Rayquaza can Mega Evolve\nwithout using a Mega Stone? It’s part of what\ndrew me to forming a sync pair with mine.",
    "charaepi_ch0090_50_daigo/2301_1201_1000_10": "But I’ve still barely scratched the surface when\nit comes to learning about its Mega Evolution.",

    "charaepi_ch0090_50_daigo/2301_0402_1400_10": "Yes, I am in a bit of a pickle. If only I could find\nsomeone well-versed in the subject.",
    "charaepi_ch0090_50_daigo/2301_1201_1500_10": "Morning, you two! Do you need help with\nanything? You look a little troubled.",

    "charaepi_ch0090_50_daigo/2301_1201_1900_10": "Ahh... Curious about Rayquaza, are you?",
    "charaepi_ch0090_50_daigo/2301_1201_2000_10": "Well, theoretically, Mega Evolution should only be\npossible through the use of two special stones by\na Trainer and Pokémon who share a strong bond.",
    "charaepi_ch0090_50_daigo/2301_1201_2100_10": "But it would seem that Rayquaza, a super-ancient\nPokémon, requires a different sort of power to\naccomplish this.",
    "charaepi_ch0090_50_daigo/2301_1201_2200_10": "That’s what I was thinking.",
    "charaepi_ch0090_50_daigo/2301_1201_2300_10": "We do have evidence that Rayquaza have eaten\nmeteorites in the Hoenn region.",
    "charaepi_ch0090_50_daigo/2301_1201_2400_10": "What do you think that could mean?",
    "charaepi_ch0090_50_daigo/2301_0301_2500_10": "It uses meteorites as an\nenergy source?",
    "charaepi_ch0090_50_daigo/2301_0401_2600_10": "Precisely. I believe that’s the correct conclusion\nas well.",

    "charaepi_ch0090_50_daigo/2301_0402_2800_10": "*chuckle* I’m not sure about that. But I do think it\nmay be able to use meteorites as some kind of\nenergy source.",
    "charaepi_ch0090_50_daigo/2301_1201_2900_10": "Ah, sorry, Rayquaza. You must be getting bored\nof all this science talk.",
