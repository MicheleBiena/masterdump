    "charaepi_ch0259_00_sania/2301_1201_2100_10": "Take Yamper, for example. I’ve spent so much\ntime researching them, and I know loads about\nthem now.",

    "charaepi_ch0259_00_sania/2301_1201_3300_10": "Hm? Yamper?",
    "charaepi_ch0259_00_sania/2301_1201_3400_10": "Oh my. You’re not in the mood to battle, are you.\nYou just want to play. I almost messed up again!\nSorry, Yamper.",

    "charaepi_ch0259_00_sania/2301_0401_4000_10": "You’ve definitely got the same sense of confidence\nthat Leon has!",
    "charaepi_ch0259_00_sania/2301_0302_4100_10": "Let’s both do our best!",
    "charaepi_ch0259_00_sania/2301_0402_4200_10": "That’s the spirit! I suppose if I’m gonna aim high,\nI might as well aim for the stars!",
    "charaepi_ch0259_00_sania/2301_1201_4300_10": "Anyway, thanks for reminding me of those good\nold days! I certainly won’t be giving up on my\ndreams any time soon!",
