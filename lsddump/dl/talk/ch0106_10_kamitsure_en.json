    "ch0106_10_kamitsure/0601_0702_01_10": "It can definitely be difficult to achieve the goals\nthat you set for yourself.",
    "ch0106_10_kamitsure/0601_0702_02_10": "I mean, even I’m no stranger to failure.",

    "ch0106_10_kamitsure/0602_0702_02_10": "But wouldn’t it be wonderful to be an electrifying\ninspiration for people?",

    "ch0106_10_kamitsure/0604_0701_02_10": "Just a pretty outfit would be boring, and just\nan eccentric one wouldn’t be satisfying enough.",
    "ch0106_10_kamitsure/0604_0701_03_10": "But this outfit has the perfect balance between\nbeauty and eccentricity.",
    "ch0106_10_kamitsure/0604_0701_04_10": "I literally cannot even.",

    "ch0106_10_kamitsure/0605_0701_02_10": "The most dazzling stories are written after\nthe characters meet, right?",
    "ch0106_10_kamitsure/0605_0701_03_10": "And only when they’ve had a beautiful story\nwritten about them, then they can decide whether\ntheir meeting was fated or not.",
    "ch0106_10_kamitsure/0605_0702_01_10": "I wonder what kind of story will be written about\nRotom and me...or you and me...",

    "ch0106_10_kamitsure/0605_0702_03_10": "And that can be a little scary, but I think it’s more\nexciting than anything!",

    "ch0106_10_kamitsure/2501_0701_03_10": "But sometimes, Skyla chooses some weird\noutfits for me to try on.",
    "ch0106_10_kamitsure/2501_0701_04_10": "I guess it’s fine. I get to try out all sorts of outfits,\nand Skyla seems to really enjoy it.",
    "ch0106_10_kamitsure/2501_0702_01_10": "Skyla has such good style. I think she could totally\nbe a model, too, if she wanted to.",
    "ch0106_10_kamitsure/2501_0702_02_10": "It’d be really fun if we could walk the same\ncatwalk someday.",

    "ch0106_10_kamitsure/2511_0701_04_10": "You’re so earnest and kind, as a Trainer and just\nas a person.",
    "ch0106_10_kamitsure/2511_0702_01_10": "I’ve never seen you be anything but nice to the\npeople and Pokémon around you.",
    "ch0106_10_kamitsure/2511_0702_02_10": "I say this without any sarcasm. It’s what makes\nyou so dazzling.",
    "ch0106_10_kamitsure/3001_0701_01_10": "Sometimes I have to wake up super early,\ndepending on what outfit I’m gonna wear.\nPerfection takes time!",
    "ch0106_10_kamitsure/3002_0701_01_10": "The air’s so clean and fresh here...\nIt feels good to take a nice, deep breath.",

    "ch0106_10_kamitsure/3005_0701_01_10": "On nights when I can’t sleep, I step outside,\nspread my arms, and bathe in the\nmoon’s spotlight.",
