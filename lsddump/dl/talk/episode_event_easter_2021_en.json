    "episode_event_easter_2021/4003_1001_3100_10": "And she was smiling a lot more than when I’ve\nseen her battling...",
    "episode_event_easter_2021/4003_1001_3200_10": "Maybe she’s gonna stop being a Trainer and give\nup battling for good to focus on fieldwork!",
    "episode_event_easter_2021/4003_1001_3300_10": "What?",
    "episode_event_easter_2021/4003_1001_3400_10": "May would never quit being a Trainer and\nstop battling...",

    "episode_event_easter_2021/4004_1001_1400_10": "Huh?",
    "episode_event_easter_2021/4004_1001_1500_10": "Would you...",
    "episode_event_easter_2021/4004_1001_1600_10": "have a battle with us?!",
    "episode_event_easter_2021/4004_1001_1700_10": "Huh? A battle?",
    "episode_event_easter_2021/4004_1001_1800_10": "Yes, please!",
    "episode_event_easter_2021/4004_1001_1900_10": "I can tell that you’re asking for this because\nsomething else is bugging you... Very well, then!\nLet’s do it!",
    "episode_event_easter_2021/4004_1001_2000_10": "I’d be happy to join, too. How about\nyou, [Name:PlayerNickname ]?",
    "episode_event_easter_2021/4004_0301_2100_10": "Of course!",
    "episode_event_easter_2021/4004_0401_2200_10": "OK! Then it’s decided!",
    "episode_event_easter_2021/4004_0302_2300_10": "I wanna battle!",
    "episode_event_easter_2021/4004_0402_2400_10": "OK, then it’s decided!",
    "episode_event_easter_2021/4004_1001_2500_10": "May, please remember...",
    "episode_event_easter_2021/4004_1001_2600_10": "Remember how fun it is to battle!",
    "episode_event_easter_2021/4004_1001_2700_10": "Go, Lopunny!",
    "episode_event_easter_2021/4004_1001_2800_10": "Yay! We won!",
    "episode_event_easter_2021/4004_1001_2900_10": "Argh, we lost! But I had so much fun!",
    "episode_event_easter_2021/4004_1001_3000_10": "Did you have fun, too, May?",
    "episode_event_easter_2021/4004_1001_3100_10": "Of course! It’s always fun to battle you, Brendan!",

    "episode_event_easter_2021/4004_1001_3300_10": "So...does that mean you’re not gonna stop\nbeing a Trainer or give up battling for good?",
    "episode_event_easter_2021/4004_1001_3400_10": "Give up battling?! Stop being a Trainer?!\nWhat are you talking about?!",
    "episode_event_easter_2021/4004_1001_3500_10": "Huh? But Barry said...",
    "episode_event_easter_2021/4004_1001_3600_10": "I see. So that’s what was bugging you.",
    "episode_event_easter_2021/4004_1001_3700_10": "Whaaat?! You mean that was just me totally\nmisreading the situation?!",
    "episode_event_easter_2021/4004_1001_3800_10": "Yeah! Don’t just make things up like that!",
    "episode_event_easter_2021/4004_1001_3900_10": "So, you really weren’t planning to stop being a\nTrainer after all?",
    "episode_event_easter_2021/4004_1001_4000_10": "Of course not!",
    "episode_event_easter_2021/4004_1001_4100_10": "I mean...I do think I might want to be a Pokémon\nProfessor one day, just like my dad!",
