    "charaepi_ch0001_00_kukui/2301_0301_0200_10": "Just wandering around.",
    "charaepi_ch0001_00_kukui/2301_0401_0300_10": "Nice! The perfect way to clear one’s head\nbetween battles.",
    "charaepi_ch0001_00_kukui/2301_0302_0400_10": "Just on a walk.",
    "charaepi_ch0001_00_kukui/2301_0402_0500_10": "Nice! The perfect way to clear one’s head\nbetween battles.",
    "charaepi_ch0001_00_kukui/2301_1201_0600_10": "I was just going around saying hi to all the\nTrainers that I battled in the past.",
    "charaepi_ch0001_00_kukui/2301_1201_0700_10": "Of course, Pokémon battles are a greeting in\nand of themselves!",
    "charaepi_ch0001_00_kukui/2301_0301_0800_10": "Was Brock one of ’em?",
    "charaepi_ch0001_00_kukui/2301_0401_0900_10": "Yep! In fact, there was a time when I traveled\nand fought Trainers all over the Kanto region!",
    "charaepi_ch0001_00_kukui/2301_0302_1000_10": "Who’ve you battled?",
    "charaepi_ch0001_00_kukui/2301_0402_1100_10": "Well, there was a time when I traveled and\nfought Trainers all over the Kanto region!",
    "charaepi_ch0001_00_kukui/2301_1201_1200_10": "It was more of a training journey! My Pokémon\nand I traveled to make ourselves stronger!",
    "charaepi_ch0001_00_kukui/2301_0301_1300_10": "That’s really cool!",
    "charaepi_ch0001_00_kukui/2301_0401_1400_10": "Thanks! Lycanroc seems to appreciate it, too!",
    "charaepi_ch0001_00_kukui/2301_0302_1500_10": "That’s why you’re strong, huh?",
    "charaepi_ch0001_00_kukui/2301_0402_1600_10": "Hmm, I suppose it is! And thanks, I’ll take the\ncompliment. Lycanroc seems to appreciate it, too!",
    "charaepi_ch0001_00_kukui/2301_1201_1700_10": "Lycanroc—when he was still a Rockruff—and \nall my other Pokémon became stronger with me\nas we journeyed through Kanto.",
    "charaepi_ch0001_00_kukui/2301_1201_1800_10": "It was because of those experiences that I was\nable to create the Alola League, yeah!",
    "charaepi_ch0001_00_kukui/2301_1201_1900_10": "Thanks to that, a lot of strong Trainers found\nthemselves in Alola.",
    "charaepi_ch0001_00_kukui/2301_1201_2000_10": "Battling against them allowed me to raise my skills\nas a Trainer and make my Pokémon even stronger!",
    "charaepi_ch0001_00_kukui/2301_1201_2100_10": "Take Brock, for example. He fights with\nRock-type Pokémon, you know.",
    "charaepi_ch0001_00_kukui/2301_1201_2200_10": "Since Lycanroc’s a Rock type, too, we had a\nleisurely...er, I mean...intense battle!",
    "charaepi_ch0001_00_kukui/2301_0301_2300_10": "That’s nice!",
    "charaepi_ch0001_00_kukui/2301_0401_2400_10": "I know, right? And Lycanroc especially seems to\nwant to get stronger.",
    "charaepi_ch0001_00_kukui/2301_0302_2500_10": "You must really like battles!",
    "charaepi_ch0001_00_kukui/2301_0402_2600_10": "You bet I do! And Lycanroc especially seems to\nwant to get stronger.",
    "charaepi_ch0001_00_kukui/2301_1201_2700_10": "A Lycanroc in its Midday Form will typically be\nvery loyal and follow its Trainer’s commands\nto a tee, yeah!",
    "charaepi_ch0001_00_kukui/2301_1201_2800_10": "But my Lycanroc is a little different,\ndespite having evolved into Midday Form.",
    "charaepi_ch0001_00_kukui/2301_1201_2900_10": "If I give an order he doesn’t like, \nhe ignores me.",
    "charaepi_ch0001_00_kukui/2301_1201_3000_10": "He acts as if he’s in Midnight Form!",
    "charaepi_ch0001_00_kukui/2301_1201_3100_10": "So that helps me get better as well! I try to get\nstronger so I can keep fighting beside Lycanroc!",
    "charaepi_ch0001_00_kukui/2301_1201_3200_10": "We’re gonna continue getting stronger,\njust like you guys are, yeah!",
    "charaepi_ch0001_00_kukui/2301_1201_3300_10": "Becoming friends is important, but that’s not the\nonly way for Trainers and their Pokémon to be.",
    "charaepi_ch0001_00_kukui/2301_0301_3400_10": "That’s all so inspiring!",
    "charaepi_ch0001_00_kukui/2301_0401_3500_10": "I’m glad. I know you have your own strengths\nand ways of interacting with your Pokémon, too!",
    "charaepi_ch0001_00_kukui/2301_0302_3600_10": "That all sounds hard...",
    "charaepi_ch0001_00_kukui/2301_0402_3700_10": "Don’t worry. I know you’ve your own strengths\nand ways of interacting with your Pokémon, too!",
    "charaepi_ch0001_00_kukui/2301_1201_3800_10": "Just out of curiosity...",
    "charaepi_ch0001_00_kukui/2301_1201_3900_10": "do you think I beat the Lance, the Indigo\nChampion, when I was in Kanto?",
    "charaepi_ch0001_00_kukui/2301_0301_4000_10": "Yeah, I think you did!",
    "charaepi_ch0001_00_kukui/2301_0401_4100_10": "You flatter me! Maybe I’ll tell you that\nstory sometime...",
    "charaepi_ch0001_00_kukui/2301_0302_4200_10": "Nah, he probably got you.",
    "charaepi_ch0001_00_kukui/2301_0402_4300_10": "Good to know where you stand!\nMaybe I’ll tell you that story sometime...",
    "charaepi_ch0001_00_kukui/2301_1201_4400_10": "Since we’ve battled each other, I’d be curious to\nhear what you think!",
