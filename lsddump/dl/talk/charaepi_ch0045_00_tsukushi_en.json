    "charaepi_ch0045_00_tsukushi/2301_0301_3800_10": "It’s not all about being strong.",
    "charaepi_ch0045_00_tsukushi/2301_0401_3900_10": "Y-you think so?\nHmm...maybe you’re right.",
    "charaepi_ch0045_00_tsukushi/2301_0302_4000_10": "You have to show off some\nother good qualities, too.",
    "charaepi_ch0045_00_tsukushi/2301_0402_4100_10": "Well, Bug-type Pokémon have a ton\nof good qualities! I should know that\nbetter than anyone else.",
    "charaepi_ch0045_00_tsukushi/2301_1201_4200_10": "Take Weedle, for example. It may look\ncute on the outside, but on the inside,\nit’s super tough!",
    "charaepi_ch0045_00_tsukushi/2301_1201_4300_10": "Kakuna still has Weedle’s toughness,\nplus it gets a hard, protective shell\non top of that!",
    "charaepi_ch0045_00_tsukushi/2301_1201_4400_10": "Then its appearance really shifts when it\nevolves into Beedrill and gets super-strong\npoisonous stingers!",
    "charaepi_ch0045_00_tsukushi/2301_1201_4500_10": "At their core, they’re all the same Pokémon,\nbut the qualities that make them awesome\nchange from Evolution to Evolution!",
    "charaepi_ch0045_00_tsukushi/2301_1201_4600_10": "Kind of mysterious, right?\nThat’s what makes Bug-type\nPokémon so interesting to me!",
    "charaepi_ch0045_00_tsukushi/2301_0301_4700_10": "You sound like a Bug-type\nPokémon Professor!",
    "charaepi_ch0045_00_tsukushi/2301_0401_4800_10": "Hehe, I DO know a lot about\nBug-type Pokémon.",
    "charaepi_ch0045_00_tsukushi/2301_0302_4900_10": "You sound like an encyclopedia!",

    "charaepi_ch0045_00_tsukushi/2301_1201_5100_10": "You’re right. I know all there is to know about\nBug-type Pokémon, so there are probably\nthings about them that only I can teach others.",
    "charaepi_ch0045_00_tsukushi/2301_1201_5200_10": "I should really thank you!\nI don’t know if I would have been able\nto realize that all on my own!",
    "charaepi_ch0045_00_tsukushi/2301_1201_5300_10": "Well, first things first...",
    "charaepi_ch0045_00_tsukushi/2301_1201_5400_10": "I think I can start by teaching people that\nBeedrill only attack with their poisonous\nstingers if they’re attacked first...",
