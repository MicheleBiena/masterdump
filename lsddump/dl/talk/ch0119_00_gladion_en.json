    "ch0119_00_gladion/0101_0701_02_10": "If you’re planning to go out and train again today,\nwe’d better go ahead and get to it.",
    "ch0119_00_gladion/0601_0701_01_10": "I used to work as hired muscle for an organization\ncalled Team Skull.",
    "ch0119_00_gladion/0601_0701_02_10": "They were a bunch of small-time punks who had\nnothing better to do than make trouble for others.",
    "ch0119_00_gladion/0601_0701_03_10": "Not that I was any different, though.",
    "ch0119_00_gladion/0601_0701_04_10": "Back then, I didn’t care what I was doing. All I\nwanted was for us to get stronger.",
    "ch0119_00_gladion/0602_0701_01_10": "I have a little sister.",
    "ch0119_00_gladion/0602_0701_02_10": "She’s pretty soft-spoken, and she used to hate\neven the thought of Pokémon battling each other.\nShe’s sweet like that.",
    "ch0119_00_gladion/0602_0701_03_10": "So sweet, in fact, that it worries me. A lot.",
    "ch0119_00_gladion/0603_0701_01_10": "Pokémon are invaluable companions, but don’t\nexpect to be all buddy-buddy with them\nright away.",
    "ch0119_00_gladion/0603_0701_02_10": "It takes a lot of time and effort to build up trust\nwith Pokémon.",
    "ch0119_00_gladion/0603_0701_03_10": "Don’t even think about trying to force them to do\nwhat you want. That’s a recipe for disaster.",
    "ch0119_00_gladion/0604_0701_01_10": "I want to become a stronger Trainer. That’s why\nI came to Pasio to continue my training.",
    "ch0119_00_gladion/0604_0701_02_10": "The way Pokémon battles are conducted here is\ninteresting. I’ve never seen anything like it before.",
    "ch0119_00_gladion/0604_0701_03_10": "I also feel like the style of battling as sync pairs\nsuits me to a T.",
    "ch0119_00_gladion/0604_0701_04_10": "Maybe because battles here foster a clear sense\nof battling side-by-side with Pokémon as equals.",
    "ch0119_00_gladion/0605_0701_01_10": "You know, [Name:PlayerNickname ]...\nYou and your partner Pokémon make a good\nsync pair.",
    "ch0119_00_gladion/0605_0701_02_10": "Watching how you two battle, I can tell what kind\nof journey you’ve been through.",
    "ch0119_00_gladion/0605_0701_03_10": "Hmph. I guess I still have a long journey ahead\nof me.",
    "ch0119_00_gladion/0605_0701_04_10": "I’m glad I have this opportunity to fight alongside\nyou two on the same team.",
    "ch0119_00_gladion/1701_0701_01_10": "Here, you can have this.",
    "ch0119_00_gladion/1701_0701_02_10": "I found it while I was training. I’m sure you’ll find\nit useful as well.",
    "ch0119_00_gladion/1701_0702_01_10": "We’re on the same team, after all. It’s the least I\ncan do.",
    "ch0119_00_gladion/2501_0701_01_10": "Someday my training journey will end. I don’t\nknow what I’ll do afterward just yet. It’s not like\nI haven’t thought about it, though.",
    "ch0119_00_gladion/2501_0701_02_10": "I want to protect everyone with my partner\nPokémon—especially my family. That much I\ndo know.",
    "ch0119_00_gladion/2501_0701_03_10": "Hmph. Look at me opening up to you like this.",
    "ch0119_00_gladion/2501_0701_04_10": "Must be something in the air here that’s making\nme soft. It’s not so bad, though, to be honest.",
    "ch0119_00_gladion/2501_0702_01_10": "Do you plan to continue your training? Have you\nthought about what to do afterwards?",
    "ch0119_00_gladion/2501_0702_02_10": "There’s no need to rush things. Just keep blazing\nforward with your partner and making your\nown path.",
    "ch0119_00_gladion/2511_0701_01_10": "Hey, [Name:PlayerNickname ].\nYour clothes are getting a little tattered.",
    "ch0119_00_gladion/2511_0701_02_10": "I bet you’ve been so caught up in your battles\nthat you didn’t even notice, huh? Hmph. Typical.",
    "ch0119_00_gladion/2511_0701_03_10": "I’ve seen this kinda wear and tear before. Nothing\nthat a little needlework won’t fix.",
    "ch0119_00_gladion/2511_0701_04_10": "What are you looking at me for? I’m not gonna fix\nyour clothes for you. That’s all you.",
    "ch0119_00_gladion/2511_0702_01_10": "What? You want me to teach you how to sew?",
    "ch0119_00_gladion/2511_0702_02_10": "I guess I can show you the ropes. Or threads,\nin this case.",
    "ch0119_00_gladion/2511_0702_03_10": "I’m self-taught, though. Don’t come crying to me\nlater if my methods don’t work for you!",
    "ch0119_00_gladion/3001_0701_01_10": "It’s morning now. Time to get cleaned up.",
    "ch0119_00_gladion/3003_0701_01_10": "It’s already afternoon? Where does the time go?",
    "ch0119_00_gladion/3005_0701_01_10": "It’s a nice night... I hope the moon shows itself.",
