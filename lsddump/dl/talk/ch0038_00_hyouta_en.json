    "ch0038_00_hyouta/0101_0701_02_10": "Man, I’ve been waiting so long now,\nI’m practically a fossil!\nKidding, kidding...",
    "ch0038_00_hyouta/0601_0701_01_10": "Both my dad and I are\nGym Leaders, you know.",
    "ch0038_00_hyouta/0601_0701_02_10": "I’ve always loved Pokémon that are\ntough and strong like boulders...",
    "ch0038_00_hyouta/0601_0701_03_10": "but my dad favors solid, heavy,\nsteel-like Pokémon.",
    "ch0038_00_hyouta/0601_0701_04_10": "You probably think they’re really similar,\nbut trust me—I’m an expert on these\nthings. They’re totally different.",
    "ch0038_00_hyouta/0601_0701_05_10": "And I mean TOTALLY different.\nI mean, a lot of rocks appear the same,\nbut in reality, no two are exactly alike.",
    "ch0038_00_hyouta/0601_0702_01_10": "How do you tell them apart, you ask?\nWell, how about you figure that out yourself?\nThat’s really the fastest route.",
    "ch0038_00_hyouta/0601_0702_02_10": "Whether or not we share the same love\nfor rocks and stones, it would make me\nreally happy if you showed some interest.",
    "ch0038_00_hyouta/0602_0701_01_10": "Back at home I work at the\nOreburgh Mine.",
    "ch0038_00_hyouta/0602_0701_02_10": "I work hard to hone my drilling skills\nat the mine so that someday I can\nachieve my dream:",
    "ch0038_00_hyouta/0602_0701_03_10": "to build a massive tunnel system\nthat connects the whole world!",
    "ch0038_00_hyouta/0602_0701_04_10": "How about you? Are you chasing a dream?\nForging your own path and working\nas hard as you can to make it happen?",
    "ch0038_00_hyouta/0602_0702_01_10": "I hope maybe someday I can use my\ntunnels to connect Pasio to the rest\nof the world!",
    "ch0038_00_hyouta/0602_0702_02_10": "I’ll have to dig pretty deep to create\nan underwater tunnel...\nBut I’m up for the challenge!",
    "ch0038_00_hyouta/0603_0701_01_10": "The island of Pasio was built on top of\na rocky ocean layer. I wonder what sort\nof hidden treasures lie beneath the surface.",
    "ch0038_00_hyouta/0603_0701_02_10": "If I could get permission somehow,\nI’d love to do some excavating here!",
    "ch0038_00_hyouta/0603_0701_03_10": "You’d be interested, right?",
    "ch0038_00_hyouta/0603_0701_04_10": "It’s settled, then! Time to come up with\na plan for our official Pasio\nexcavation tour!",
    "ch0038_00_hyouta/0603_0702_01_10": "I wonder who we need to get permission\nfrom. Well, time waits for no one!\nWe’ve got lots of planning to do!",
    "ch0038_00_hyouta/0603_0702_02_10": "Wait... I’ve already got a ton of other\nlocations I’d like to excavate, too!\nI think I need to sort out my priorities first.",
    "ch0038_00_hyouta/0604_0701_01_10": "My dad has a friend named Riley.",
    "ch0038_00_hyouta/0604_0701_02_10": "He’s a bit of a mystery, but he’s\na real solid Pokémon Trainer.",
    "ch0038_00_hyouta/0604_0701_03_10": "I wonder if he’s here on Pasio as well...\nIt would be awesome to meet up with him.",
    "ch0038_00_hyouta/0604_0702_01_10": "You’ll know Riley when you see him!\nHe wears a fancy blue suit and a\nnice blue hat...",
    "ch0038_00_hyouta/0604_0702_02_10": "so he tends to stand out in a crowd\nno matter where he is!",
    "ch0038_00_hyouta/0605_0701_01_10": "Hey, [Name:PlayerNickname ]!",
    "ch0038_00_hyouta/0605_0701_02_10": "The Pasio lifestyle sure has piqued my\ninterest so far!",
    "ch0038_00_hyouta/0605_0701_03_10": "There’s still so much I don’t know!",
    "ch0038_00_hyouta/0605_0701_04_10": "Like what’s buried just below the\nsurface of the ground where we’re\nstanding right now. Stuff like that!",
    "ch0038_00_hyouta/0605_0701_05_10": "It would really rock my world if there\nwere rare fossils beneath here...",
    "ch0038_00_hyouta/0605_0702_01_10": "But either way, there are plenty of\nways to have fun here besides just\nPokémon battles!",
    "ch0038_00_hyouta/1701_0701_01_10": "I dug up something interesting today!\nWhat do you think? Awesome, right?",
    "ch0038_00_hyouta/1701_0701_02_10": "I thought I’d give it to you if you want it!",
    "ch0038_00_hyouta/1701_0702_01_10": "If I dig up anything else, I’ll bring it over.",
    "ch0038_00_hyouta/1701_0702_02_10": "You’d be amazed by some of the things\nthat get unearthed when you’re excavating!",
    "ch0038_00_hyouta/2501_0701_01_10": "I respect my dad a lot, and I’ve always\nlooked up to him, but it’s not just\nbecause he’s my dad.",
    "ch0038_00_hyouta/2501_0701_02_10": "He’s a Gym Leader just like me,\nbut he’s way, way stronger than I am.",
    "ch0038_00_hyouta/2501_0701_03_10": "Coming from his son, I guess that might\nbe a little hard to believe. But trust me,\nit’s the truth.",
    "ch0038_00_hyouta/2501_0701_04_10": "My dad’s...infinitely stronger than I am!",
    "ch0038_00_hyouta/2501_0702_01_10": "I don’t think my dad’s always\nbeen this strong.",
    "ch0038_00_hyouta/2501_0702_02_10": "Over the years, he trained and trained\nand trained to become as powerful\nas he is now.",
    "ch0038_00_hyouta/2501_0702_03_10": "That’s why I need to keep on digging!\nI’ll dig and dig and dig so that someday\nI’ll be that strong, too!",
    "ch0038_00_hyouta/2501_0702_04_10": "One day I’ll be as strong—no,\nSTRONGER than my dad!",
    "ch0038_00_hyouta/2511_0701_01_10": "Sometimes when I’m working down in the\ncoal mines, I get so caught up in digging\nthat I lose track of the time.",
    "ch0038_00_hyouta/2511_0701_02_10": "The other day, my Pokémon came \ndown the mine to give me some water \nwhile I was focused on my work.",
    "ch0038_00_hyouta/2511_0701_03_10": "Despite my tunnel vision, I always\nremember to stay hydrated, but the\nkind gesture did make me happy.",
    "ch0038_00_hyouta/2511_0702_01_10": "It’s nice that my Pokémon worries about me,\nbut while I’m on the job, all the other workers\nreally depend on me.",
    "ch0038_00_hyouta/2511_0702_02_10": "I’m the leader down in the Oreburgh\nMine, after all!",
    "ch0038_00_hyouta/2511_0702_03_10": "If you ever need a hand, you can count on me. \nI’ll show you what a huge help I can be!",
    "ch0038_00_hyouta/3001_0701_01_10": "Whoa, it’s already morning?\nIt’s so bright up here compared to the mines.",
    "ch0038_00_hyouta/3002_0701_01_10": "*yawn*\nSorry, I just got back.\nI was out digging a tunnel!",
    "ch0038_00_hyouta/3003_0701_01_10": "Hey! It’s perfect tunnel-digging weather!",
    "ch0038_00_hyouta/3004_0701_01_10": "Hey there! You know it’s not good to\nstay cooped up inside all the time.\nEverybody needs a little sunshine!",
    "ch0038_00_hyouta/3005_0701_01_10": "Hi there! It may be dark outside, but I’m still\nfull of energy! I’m used to being in the dark!\n",
    "ch0038_00_hyouta/3006_0701_01_10": "Wow, it’s already dark out?\nTime for me to go dig some tunnels!",
