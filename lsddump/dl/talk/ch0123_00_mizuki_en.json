    "ch0123_00_mizuki/0601_0701_01_10": "Of course I’m interested in Pokémon battles,\nbut there’s another thing I’d like to try while I’m\nhere on Pasio.",
    "ch0123_00_mizuki/0601_0701_02_10": "And that’s getting more people to use the word\n“Alola!” as a greeting!",
    "ch0123_00_mizuki/0601_0701_03_10": "I think it would make people feel happier than just\nthe usual hello. Why don’t you give it a try?",
    "ch0123_00_mizuki/0602_0701_01_10": "My mom spends most of her time at home with\nour Meowth.",

    "ch0123_00_mizuki/0603_0701_04_10": "If you visit Alola, you should definitely try it! It’s\nmy number-one recommendation of all the things\nto do there!",
    "ch0123_00_mizuki/0604_0701_01_10": "We have a lot of famous sights and activities in\nAlola, but my favorite is the Mantine Surf!",
    "ch0123_00_mizuki/0604_0701_02_10": "We go out surfing on Mantine, build up speed,\nand do jumps and flips!",
    "ch0123_00_mizuki/0604_0701_03_10": "And in the end, we dive into the ocean with a\nhuge splash! *chuckle* It’s hard to land our\ntricks sometimes.",

    "ch0123_00_mizuki/0605_0701_03_10": "It’s thanks to all of us working together that I was\nable to complete my island challenge.",
    "ch0123_00_mizuki/0605_0701_04_10": "Just thinking about it makes me want to see\nthem all again!",
    "ch0123_00_mizuki/1701_0701_01_10": "Alola! I found something interesting earlier!",

    "ch0123_00_mizuki/2501_0701_02_10": "At first, I was really worried about whether I\nwould fit in. But everyone was super nice, and\nI made a lot of friends really quick!",
    "ch0123_00_mizuki/2501_0701_03_10": "Now, I feel like Alola’s where I belong! I guess\nit’s because I keep saying Alola to everyone\nevery day!",
    "ch0123_00_mizuki/2501_0702_01_10": "Sometimes, people ask me which I like better,\nKanto or Alola.",
    "ch0123_00_mizuki/2501_0702_02_10": "But the truth is, I love them both equally!",
    "ch0123_00_mizuki/2501_0702_03_10": "Kanto is Kanto, and Alola is Alola!\nEach region has its own charm!",
    "ch0123_00_mizuki/2501_0702_04_10": "I can’t just choose one over the other! That’s why\nI like them both!",
    "ch0123_00_mizuki/2511_0701_01_10": "The excitement has been nonstop ever since I\narrived on Pasio!",
    "ch0123_00_mizuki/2511_0701_02_10": "It really reminds me of the island challenge back\nin Alola.",
