    "episode_event_autumn_2020/4002_1001_2200_10": "Exhausted already? You’re just getting lazy now,\nHilbert. Remember how hard we used to fight on\nthe Battle Subway?",
    "episode_event_autumn_2020/4002_1001_2300_10": "Yeah, of course I do. But battling isn’t what’s\nmaking me exhausted... Listen, Hilda. I think\nyou’re confused.",
    "episode_event_autumn_2020/4002_1001_2400_10": "Huh? What are you talking about?",
    "episode_event_autumn_2020/4002_1001_2500_10": "Ohhh... Fight or fright, huh? Why didn’t you just\ntell me all of that in the first place?",
    "episode_event_autumn_2020/4002_1001_2600_10": "Acerola tried, but you rushed us into a battle\nbefore she could finish explaining...",

    "episode_event_autumn_2020/4002_1001_2800_10": "Besides, if you’re looking for candy, I think I might\nhave a lead for you! The people I battled earlier\nactually gave me some!",

    "episode_event_autumn_2020/4003_1001_1000_10": "It couldn’t be a wild Pokémon, could it? There\naren’t supposed to be any on Pasio...",
    "episode_event_autumn_2020/4003_1001_1100_10": "Wait, I think something else is hiding over there!\nEveryone, get behind me!",
    "episode_event_autumn_2020/4003_1001_1200_10": "Yay! It’s another Ghost Pokémon! Tonight must be\nmy lucky night, you guys!",
    "episode_event_autumn_2020/4003_1001_1300_10": "And where did you come from, cutie pie?\nWanna come play in the forest with us?",
    "episode_event_autumn_2020/4003_1001_1400_10": "Something’s not right here... That’s the second\nPokémon we’ve encountered without its\nTrainer tonight...",
    "episode_event_autumn_2020/4003_0301_1500_10": "I saw something in the bushes!",

    "episode_event_autumn_2020/4003_1001_2200_10": "Wait a sec... I feel like I’ve seen these three\nPokémon together somewhere before...",

    "episode_event_autumn_2020/4003_1001_2400_10": "Huh? I think I recognize that voice...",

    "episode_event_autumn_2020/4004_1001_0400_10": "I didn’t think I could make someone so happy just\nby wearing a costume! I’m glad I dressed up.",
    "episode_event_autumn_2020/4004_1001_0500_10": "Me too! The look on Shauntal’s face alone makes\nall the effort worth it. She looks so happy!",
    "episode_event_autumn_2020/4004_0301_0600_10": "What brings you here, Shauntal?",
    "episode_event_autumn_2020/4004_0401_0700_10": "Ahh, there you are, Shaunt— Wait, what’s going\non here?",
    "episode_event_autumn_2020/4004_0302_0800_10": "Did you come here alone?",

    "episode_event_autumn_2020/4004_1001_1000_10": "I came this way looking for our Pokémon, but I\nended up finding Acerola and the others, too!\nWe were just chatting a bit!",
    "episode_event_autumn_2020/4004_1001_1100_10": "A bit, huh? All of that fresh ink in your notebook\nseems to suggest otherwise.",
    "episode_event_autumn_2020/4004_1001_1200_10": "Oh, how could I NOT write, Morty? Have you\nseen the wonderful costumes these two are\nwearing tonight?!",
    "episode_event_autumn_2020/4004_1001_1300_10": "Acerola looks like the spitting image of Mimikyu\nin that adorable hood, doesn’t she? It’s like she\nused Disguise herself!",
    "episode_event_autumn_2020/4004_1001_1400_10": "And Hilbert looks just like a Mightyena lurking\nin the shadows, waiting for the perfect opportunity\nto leap out and catch his prey!",
    "episode_event_autumn_2020/4004_1001_1500_10": "With such perfect muses right before my eyes,\nthis novel is practically writing itself!",
    "episode_event_autumn_2020/4004_1001_1600_10": "That’s all fine and dandy, as long as you\nhaven’t forgotten the reason we came here in\nthe first place.",
    "episode_event_autumn_2020/4004_1001_1700_10": "Wait a minute... Did you three come here to\nget candy, too?!",
    "episode_event_autumn_2020/4004_1001_1800_10": "Candy? Ah, you mean that “fight or fright” thing...\nSorry, child. That’s not why we’re here.",
    "episode_event_autumn_2020/4004_1001_1900_10": "We’ve all gathered here for the Midnight Parade.",
    "episode_event_autumn_2020/4004_1001_2000_10": "We Ghost-type users are going to march through\ntown with our Pokémon while all of the spooky\ndecorations are on display.",
    "episode_event_autumn_2020/4004_1001_2100_10": "The magical, mysterious atmosphere downtown\ninspired us to do something extra special!",

    "episode_event_autumn_2020/4004_0301_2400_10": "Me too!",
    "episode_event_autumn_2020/4004_0401_2500_10": "I had a feeling you’d say that. What do you think,\nMorty? Shauntal?",
    "episode_event_autumn_2020/4004_0302_2600_10": "That sounds like fun!",
    "episode_event_autumn_2020/4004_0402_2700_10": "Do you want to join in, too, then? Morty, Shauntal,\nwhat do you think?",
    "episode_event_autumn_2020/4004_1001_2800_10": "I would love to have all of you join the parade!\nBut first, we’ll need to make sure you’re apt\nto participate, right, Morty?",
    "episode_event_autumn_2020/4004_1001_2900_10": "That’s right. If you can prove your knowledge of\nGhost-type Pokémon by defeating us in a battle,\nyou can join us in the parade.",
    "episode_event_autumn_2020/4004_1001_3000_10": "And as long as you say the magic words,\nwe’ll throw some candy in as well.",
    "episode_event_autumn_2020/4004_1001_3100_10": "Really?! You’ll give us candy, too?!",
    "episode_event_autumn_2020/4004_1001_3200_10": "In that case, I’ll give this battle everything\nI’ve got! No holding back!",
    "episode_event_autumn_2020/4004_1001_3300_10": "Come on, guys! That candy is as good as ours!\nFight or fright!",

    "episode_event_autumn_2020/4005_1001_0300_10": "What a magnificent battle! I’m sure you’ll do\nwonderfully in the parade!",
    "episode_event_autumn_2020/4005_1001_0400_10": "Agreed. You three did impressively well.\nI almost want to ask for a rematch just so that\nwe can continue training together...",
    "episode_event_autumn_2020/4005_1001_0500_10": "But I suppose that can wait for another time.",
    "episode_event_autumn_2020/4005_1001_0600_10": "Oh ho! I think that would be wise, Morty!\nBest you save that secret training of yours\nfor another day.",
    "episode_event_autumn_2020/4005_1001_0700_10": "Now, then! I think it’s time we show Pasio just\nhow magnificent we Ghost-type users can be.",
    "episode_event_autumn_2020/4006_1001_0100_10": "Yay, yay! Sooo many ghooosts!\nLook, it’s Mimikyu! Cuuuute!",

    "episode_event_autumn_2020/4006_1001_0400_10": "Thanks! Mightyena and I are twins today!",
    "episode_event_autumn_2020/4006_1001_0500_10": "Mightyena looks so cool, toooo! Can we have a\nbattle?! I wanna see you guys fight together!",
    "episode_event_autumn_2020/4006_1001_0600_10": "Did I hear something about a battle?\nDon’t forget about me!",
    "episode_event_autumn_2020/4006_1001_0700_10": "Me too! Me too! I wanna battle, too!\nFight or fwight!",
