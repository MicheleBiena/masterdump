    "ch0014_01_cheren/0602_0701_03_10": "but I will say this: the trust and friendship\nthat I’ve built up with Stoutland is\nsecond to none.",

    "ch0014_01_cheren/0602_0702_03_10": "And not just reading books, mind you.\nA lot of it was observation. It’s important to\nlearn what sort of personality your Pokémon has.",
    "ch0014_01_cheren/0603_0701_01_10": "My job at the Trainers’ School is to teach\nyoung Trainers all about Pokémon.",

    "ch0014_01_cheren/0604_0701_03_10": "It’s not enough to just read and study. You’ve\ngot to go out and experience the world\nwith your own two eyes.",
    "ch0014_01_cheren/0604_0702_01_10": "That reminds me—I have a friend who wants to\ngo do some sight-seeing. I think I might\nfollow along.",
    "ch0014_01_cheren/0604_0702_02_10": "Funny thing is, up until recently, I don’t think\nI would have said that. The old me couldn’t\nbe bothered.",
    "ch0014_01_cheren/0605_0701_01_10": "Hey, [Name:PlayerNickname ].\nIf you ever get a chance to visit the\nUnova region, you should come visit my Gym.",

    "ch0014_01_cheren/2501_0701_01_10": "Hmm. I wonder what kind of battle strategies\nwe could utilize with your Pokémon and mine.",
    "ch0014_01_cheren/2501_0701_02_10": "Oops, sorry about that.\nSometimes I get lost in my thoughts.",
    "ch0014_01_cheren/2501_0701_03_10": "Being both a Gym Leader and a teacher,\nI tend to have a lot on my mind\nat any given time.",

    "ch0014_01_cheren/2501_0702_02_10": "If you brainstorm your battle strategies\nbeforehand, you’ll be able to quickly adapt\nto any obstacle you face later on.",
    "ch0014_01_cheren/2501_0702_03_10": "However, just because that method works for\nme doesn’t necessarily mean it’s best for you.",
    "ch0014_01_cheren/2501_0702_04_10": "Everyone should be free to seek out\nwhatever battle methods work best for them.",

    "ch0014_01_cheren/2511_0702_01_10": "I’ve gone through a lot to get where I am today,\nboth good and bad.",
    "ch0014_01_cheren/2511_0702_02_10": "But honestly, going off on my own as a Trainer\nand traveling throughout the Unova region\nwas the best thing that ever happened to me.",
    "ch0014_01_cheren/2511_0702_03_10": "I hope that one day you feel the same about\nthe experiences you’re having right here\nand right now.",
