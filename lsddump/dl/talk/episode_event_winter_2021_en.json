    "episode_event_winter_2021/4001_0402_0600_10": "Oh, you can tell? Actually, I was really looking\nforward to today.",

    "episode_event_winter_2021/4001_1001_1000_10": "So I’m looking forward to seeing them today!",
    "episode_event_winter_2021/4001_1001_1100_10": "I was so excited that I left work earlier than usual!",
    "episode_event_winter_2021/4001_1001_1200_10": "OK! I believe we’re ready!",

    "episode_event_winter_2021/4002_1001_0500_10": "Or maybe you were so engrossed in your research\nthat you didn’t have time to read it?",

    "episode_event_winter_2021/4002_1001_0700_10": "That’s exactly what happened, huh.",
    "episode_event_winter_2021/4002_1001_0800_10": "And we didn’t have enough time to tell you in\nperson, either...",
    "episode_event_winter_2021/4002_1001_0900_10": "I suppose that can’t be helped.",

    "episode_event_winter_2021/4002_1001_1500_10": "Yeah, I suppose we should get a move on! See\nyou later, OK, Sonia?",
    "episode_event_winter_2021/4002_1001_1600_10": "Yeah! Be careful out there!",

    "episode_event_winter_2021/4002_1001_2000_10": "You’re loving the snow, huh. Why don’t we go for\na nice walk, then?",

    "episode_event_winter_2021/4003_1001_0500_10": "Say...do you have any plans after this?",
    "episode_event_winter_2021/4003_1001_0600_10": "Me? Well, I’ve still got a lot of research to do,\nso I was thinking of calling it a day...",
    "episode_event_winter_2021/4003_1001_0700_10": "I thought you might say that. But I was really\nhoping to hang out with you and Leon today.",
    "episode_event_winter_2021/4003_1001_0800_10": "I...I’d like to do that, too!",
    "episode_event_winter_2021/4003_1001_0900_10": "But since you’re both busy today, I figured it’d be\nbest not to get in the way...",
    "episode_event_winter_2021/4003_1001_1000_10": "To tell you the truth, I actually am feeling kind of\nlonely... Because it feels like we all keep drifting\nfurther apart.",
    "episode_event_winter_2021/4003_1001_1100_10": "Um... Actually, I’ve got a little something for\nyou, too.",
    "episode_event_winter_2021/4003_1001_1200_10": "Oh, wow! Is this what I think it is?",
    "episode_event_winter_2021/4003_1001_1300_10": "You remember these Lumiose Galettes?",
    "episode_event_winter_2021/4003_1001_1400_10": "Of course I do!",
    "episode_event_winter_2021/4003_1001_1500_10": "Every time I lost at Motostoke Gym, we’d head\nover to the Battle Café, and I’d ask you and Leon\nfor advice!",
    "episode_event_winter_2021/4003_1001_1600_10": "We really ate a lot of these, come to think of it!",
    "episode_event_winter_2021/4003_1001_1700_10": "I was hoping we could share this one at the\nwinter soiree! With Leon too, of course!",
    "episode_event_winter_2021/4003_1001_1800_10": "Also, we still haven’t celebrated you becoming\na professor yet!",
    "episode_event_winter_2021/4003_1001_1900_10": "As your best friend, you’ve got to let me do at\nleast that much, right?",
    "episode_event_winter_2021/4003_1001_2000_10": "Nessa...",
    "episode_event_winter_2021/4003_1001_2100_10": "Thanks! Let’s eat it together, then!",
    "episode_event_winter_2021/4004_1001_0100_10": "By the way...what happened to your\npartner, Eiscue?",
    "episode_event_winter_2021/4004_1001_0200_10": "Oh, he’s over there.",
    "episode_event_winter_2021/4004_1001_0300_10": "Heeey! We’re leaving soon, OK?",
    "episode_event_winter_2021/4004_1001_0400_10": "Um... Was Eiscue just fishing with the hair on\nhis head?",
    "episode_event_winter_2021/4004_1001_0500_10": "Uh-huh. Once he starts, he won’t budge from that\nspot, so I figured I’d come talk to you for a bit.",
    "episode_event_winter_2021/4004_1001_0600_10": "It’s so silly, because there aren’t any wild Pokémon\nto fish for here on Pasio!",
    "episode_event_winter_2021/4004_1001_0700_10": "I told him that myself, but he’s so stubborn...",
    "episode_event_winter_2021/4004_1001_0800_10": "Really, you’re the one saying that, now? Didn’t you\ndo the exact same thing before, too?",
    "episode_event_winter_2021/4004_1001_0900_10": "Yeah, I remember that! I kept trying to fish in a\nspot you told me didn’t have any Pokémon!",
    "episode_event_winter_2021/4004_1001_1000_10": "And in the end, I didn’t get a single bite. I guess\nI should’ve listened to a future Pokémon\nProfessor, huh.",
    "episode_event_winter_2021/4004_1001_1100_10": "Y’know...to be honest, I’ve been worried about\nsome things, too.",
    "episode_event_winter_2021/4004_1001_1200_10": "I decided that I was going to be equally invested\nin both modeling and being a Pokémon Trainer.",
    "episode_event_winter_2021/4004_1001_1300_10": "But in the Galar Gym Challenge, my Gym is the\nsecond that challengers visit...which means I’m still\nnot as strong as I’d hoped.",
    "episode_event_winter_2021/4004_1001_1400_10": "I still can’t seem to beat Leon...and I have to\nadmit, I felt some pressure when I heard you’d\nalready became a Pokémon Professor!",
    "episode_event_winter_2021/4004_1001_1500_10": "I see...",
    "episode_event_winter_2021/4004_1001_1600_10": "But right now on Pasio, I’m getting exposure to all\nsorts of Trainers and experiences!",
    "episode_event_winter_2021/4004_1001_1700_10": "There’s other models like Elesa...",
    "episode_event_winter_2021/4004_1001_1800_10": "and Lana likes fishing, too, so we get along\nquite well.",
    "episode_event_winter_2021/4004_1001_1900_10": "I totally get that! There’s a lot of veteran Pokémon\nProfessors here on Pasio, too!",
    "episode_event_winter_2021/4004_1001_2000_10": "Ever since I got here, I feel like I’m getting back in\nthe groove for battling again!",
    "episode_event_winter_2021/4004_1001_2100_10": "Oh, really? In that case, I’d love to challenge you\nto a match as well.",
    "episode_event_winter_2021/4004_1001_2200_10": "Especially with my new partner!",
    "episode_event_winter_2021/4004_1001_2300_10": "Sure! Once things calm down a bit more, let’s\nhave ourselves a nice battle!",
    "episode_event_winter_2021/4004_1001_2400_10": "Hm... Where on Pasio has Leon gone to deliver\nthose presents?",
    "episode_event_winter_2021/4004_1001_2500_10": "I hope I can find him so I can give him these\nextra deliveries!",
    "episode_event_winter_2021/4005_1001_0100_10": "Come on, Calyrex! No time to rest—let’s deliver\nthe next present!",
    "episode_event_winter_2021/4005_1001_0200_10": "You all right there, mate?",
    "episode_event_winter_2021/4005_1001_0300_10": "I guess we are overdue for a break with how\nfast we were going.",
    "episode_event_winter_2021/4005_1001_0400_10": "Why don’t we head back to where everyone\nelse is?",
    "episode_event_winter_2021/4005_1001_0500_10": "There you are!",
    "episode_event_winter_2021/4005_1001_0600_10": "No wonder I couldn’t find you!",
    "episode_event_winter_2021/4005_1001_0700_10": "I thought I heard someone calling out for me!",
    "episode_event_winter_2021/4005_1001_0800_10": "It’s my job as Champion to make an appearance\nwhenever I’m called!",
    "episode_event_winter_2021/4005_1001_0900_10": "Hm? What’s wrong, Calyrex? Excited\nabout something?",
    "episode_event_winter_2021/4005_1001_1000_10": "That’s a fine crown you’ve got there. Perhaps one\nday the young master will also have one, too...",
    "episode_event_winter_2021/4005_1001_1100_10": "Hm? Wha—",
    "episode_event_winter_2021/4005_1001_1200_10": "Bwah?!",
    "episode_event_winter_2021/4005_1001_1300_10": "Mlerrrgh...",
    "episode_event_winter_2021/4005_1001_1400_10": "A-are you OK, Sawyer?",
    "episode_event_winter_2021/4005_1001_1500_10": "Calyrex? Did you do this?",
    "episode_event_winter_2021/4005_1001_1600_10": "Ah, yes. A sturdy body, just as I expected.",
    "episode_event_winter_2021/4005_1001_1700_10": "I hope he doesn’t mind that I make use of it for the\ntime being.",
    "episode_event_winter_2021/4005_1001_1800_10": "Is this voice...Calyrex?",
    "episode_event_winter_2021/4005_1001_1900_10": "Verily. I must say that I am impressed at your \ncomposure in this situation... Though I suppose\nthat’s indeed why you are a Champion.",
    "episode_event_winter_2021/4005_1001_2000_10": "I have borrowed this man’s body in order to\nhave a word with you in person...so to speak.",
    "episode_event_winter_2021/4005_1001_2100_10": "Your strength is befitting of a king.",
    "episode_event_winter_2021/4005_1001_2200_10": "However, I do see how such strength may perhaps\nbecome a burden to you.",
    "episode_event_winter_2021/4005_1001_2300_10": "What do you mean?",
    "episode_event_winter_2021/4005_1001_2400_10": "You always force yourself to live up to the\nexpectations of those around you...and you\nbusy yourself with fulfilling these obligations.",
    "episode_event_winter_2021/4005_1001_2500_10": "This is a remarkable quality of yours—indeed, it is\nperhaps the reason why you’ve been a crowned\nChampion for as long as you have.",
    "episode_event_winter_2021/4005_1001_2600_10": "However, the further you push yourself to greater\nheights, the harder others will struggle to keep\nup with you.",
    "episode_event_winter_2021/4005_1001_2700_10": "... ... ...",
    "episode_event_winter_2021/4005_1001_2800_10": "You should reflect on this...as once something\nprecious has been lost, it may be too late to\nget it back.",
    "episode_event_winter_2021/4005_1001_2900_10": "By isolating yourself, you may be making\nothers lonely.",
    "episode_event_winter_2021/4005_1001_3000_10": "It takes a significant amount of time and effort to\nregain what has once been lost.",
    "episode_event_winter_2021/4005_1001_3100_10": "And remember, it is also possible that something\nlost may never return.",
    "episode_event_winter_2021/4005_1001_3200_10": "Hm... I see your point.",
    "episode_event_winter_2021/4005_1001_3300_10": "Thanks, Calyrex! You really have been looking out\nfor us all this time, haven’t you.",
    "episode_event_winter_2021/4005_1001_3400_10": "It was never my intention to make anyone sad\nor lonely.",
    "episode_event_winter_2021/4005_1001_3500_10": "But that said, I am a Champion.",
    "episode_event_winter_2021/4005_1001_3600_10": "No matter what happens, that’ll never change.",
    "episode_event_winter_2021/4005_1001_3700_10": "So making time for the people important to\nme is also my duty as Champion!",
    "episode_event_winter_2021/4005_1001_3800_10": "Not to worry. I was thinking of ways to make it\nwork out, too.",
    "episode_event_winter_2021/4005_1001_3900_10": "I did notice that you seemed to be in a hurry while\ndelivering your presents.",
    "episode_event_winter_2021/4005_1001_4000_10": "If that is so...",
    "episode_event_winter_2021/4005_1001_4100_10": "Very well. I will do my best to support you in\nthis endeavor.",
    "episode_event_winter_2021/4005_1001_4200_10": "Bwah?!",
    "episode_event_winter_2021/4005_1001_4300_10": "Did I just nod off? Have I been working too much?",
    "episode_event_winter_2021/4005_1001_4400_10": "Sorry ’bout that, Leon. But anyway, could you help\nus deliver these extra presents, too?",
    "episode_event_winter_2021/4005_1001_4500_10": "I’ll see you around.",
    "episode_event_winter_2021/4005_1001_4600_10": "OK. Time to show everyone how the unbeatable\nLeon gets the job done!",
    "episode_event_winter_2021/4007_1001_0100_10": "Thank you for joining me today, Sonia. It’s a bit\nembarrassing to eat sweets all by myself...",
    "episode_event_winter_2021/4007_1001_0200_10": "I don’t think it’s anything to be embarrassed about,\nbut either way, glad I could help!",
    "episode_event_winter_2021/4007_1001_0300_10": "I’m pretty sure most people just thought I roped\nyou into joining me for some dessert, anyway!",
    "episode_event_winter_2021/4007_1001_0400_10": "I suppose so!",
    "episode_event_winter_2021/4007_1001_0500_10": "... ... ...",
    "episode_event_winter_2021/4007_1001_0600_10": "Um... If you don’t mind me asking, are you thinking\nabout Leon and Nessa?",
    "episode_event_winter_2021/4007_1001_0700_10": "Huh?! Um, no, it’s nothing like that...",
    "episode_event_winter_2021/4007_1001_0800_10": "Once they’re done delivering presents, you have\nplans to meet up with them, right?",
    "episode_event_winter_2021/4007_1001_0900_10": "Don’t worry. This is just my intuition speaking, but\nI’m sure they’ll make it in time.",
    "episode_event_winter_2021/4007_1001_1000_10": "Bea...",
    "episode_event_winter_2021/4007_1001_1100_10": "Sorry to keep you waiting, Sonia!",
    "episode_event_winter_2021/4007_1001_1200_10": "L-Leon? You’ve finished delivering all those\npresents already?",
    "episode_event_winter_2021/4007_1001_1300_10": "Yeah! Thanks to Calyrex pitching in to help, we’ve\nfinished in record time!",
    "episode_event_winter_2021/4007_1001_1400_10": "After all, today’s a rare chance for all of us to\nbe together!",
    "episode_event_winter_2021/4007_1001_1500_10": "And...well, I’ve also got this for you.",
    "episode_event_winter_2021/4007_1001_1600_10": "Oh my gosh! A new lab coat?!",
    "episode_event_winter_2021/4007_1001_1700_10": "I wasn’t sure what to get you, but I figured this is\nsomething you’ll definitely need!",
    "episode_event_winter_2021/4007_1001_1800_10": "Sorry it’s late, but congrats on your promotion to\nPokémon Professor, Sonia!",
    "episode_event_winter_2021/4007_1001_1900_10": "And also...thanks for always helping me out!",
    "episode_event_winter_2021/4007_1001_2000_10": "Whoa, what’s all this about all of a sudden?\nYou’ve never done anything like this before!",
    "episode_event_winter_2021/4007_1001_2100_10": "I was thinking of waiting until things calmed down\na bit for you, but the way things are going, that\ndoesn’t seem likely!",
    "episode_event_winter_2021/4007_1001_2200_10": "So it ended up becoming a winter soiree gift\ninstead, but...",
    "episode_event_winter_2021/4007_1001_2300_10": "You really always helped me out, so I wanted to\nmake sure I could give this to you in person!",
    "episode_event_winter_2021/4007_1001_2400_10": "Oh...thank you, Leon! This is so thoughtful.",
