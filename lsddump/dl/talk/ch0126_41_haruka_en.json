    "ch0126_41_haruka/7101_0701_03_10": "It’s almost as if I’m flying through the sky on Latias!",
    "ch0126_41_haruka/7102_0701_01_10": "Sometimes I do fieldwork on my own, but other\ntimes, I go with my father.",
    "ch0126_41_haruka/7102_0701_02_10": "Can you imagine my father’s face if he saw\nthis outfit?",
    "ch0126_41_haruka/7102_0701_03_10": "Would he be surprised? What do you think?",

    "ch0126_41_haruka/2511_0701_01_10": "I think the first step in becoming friends with\nsomeone might be to learn more about them.",
    "ch0126_41_haruka/2511_0701_02_10": "That’s why doing fieldwork to learn about the\necosystems Pokémon live in is an important first\nstep to becoming friends with them!",
    "ch0126_41_haruka/2511_0701_03_10": "I want to be friends with Pokémon from\nall around the world someday!",
    "ch0126_41_haruka/2511_0702_01_10": "Although, maybe it’s better to not get too focused\non becoming friends.",
    "ch0126_41_haruka/2511_0702_02_10": "Sometimes I’ll realize I’ve made an important\nfriend without even trying!",
