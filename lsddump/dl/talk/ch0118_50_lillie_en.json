    "ch0118_50_lillie/7101_0701_01_10": "Isn’t this dress lovely?",
    "ch0118_50_lillie/7101_0701_02_10": "It reminds me of when I used to go stargazing\nwith my mother when I was young.",
    "ch0118_50_lillie/7101_0701_03_10": "For me, this outfit is almost nostalgic... It makes\nme feel like I’m never alone!",
    "ch0118_50_lillie/7102_0701_01_10": "Did you know that Cosmog evolves into Cosmoem?",
    "ch0118_50_lillie/7102_0701_02_10": "In the distant past, Cosmoem used to be called the\ncocoon of the stars. It almost sounds like it’d be a\nBug-type Pokémon, doesn’t it?",
    "ch0118_50_lillie/7103_0701_01_10": "As long as I’m with Lunala, there’s no end to how\nmuch of the world we can explore!",
    "ch0118_50_lillie/7103_0701_02_10": "I just hope I can always be together with my\nPokémon...and that you can do the same with\nyour partner, too!",
    "ch0118_50_lillie/7104_0701_01_10": "When I first started traveling around Alola, I had\nto rely on Max Repels. Even now, I always keep\ntrack of how many I have on me.",
    "ch0118_50_lillie/7104_0701_02_10": "If you’re wondering, I actually don’t have any on\nme right now because I don’t need them on Pasio!",
    "ch0118_50_lillie/7105_0701_01_10": "Before, I only used to wear what my mother\nbought for me.",
    "ch0118_50_lillie/7105_0701_02_10": "But I started going shopping with my friends here\non Pasio, and now I have some experience\nshopping for my own clothes!",
    "ch0118_50_lillie/7105_0701_03_10": "I’m a little worried about this dress... I do hope\nI’m pulling it off OK...",
    "ch0118_50_lillie/7105_0701_04_10": "What do you think, [Name:PlayerNickname ]?\nDoes it look OK on me?",
    "ch0118_50_lillie/1701_0701_01_10": "I’ve been looking all over for you! Here you go!",
    "ch0118_50_lillie/1701_0702_01_10": "Lunala found it! I hope you like it!",
    "ch0118_50_lillie/2501_0701_01_10": "Whenever I look at Lunala, I remember Nebby, the\nCosmog I used to travel with.",
    "ch0118_50_lillie/2501_0701_02_10": "I’ve left Nebby with someone I trust, so I don’t\nhave to worry right now...",
    "ch0118_50_lillie/2501_0701_03_10": "But I can’t wait till I can see them both again!",
    "ch0118_50_lillie/2501_0701_04_10": "Do you know what I mean?",
    "ch0118_50_lillie/2501_0702_01_10": "Lunala is always so cool! I wonder if I should give\nit a title!",
    "ch0118_50_lillie/2501_0702_02_10": "Like maybe...The Great Lunala?",
    "ch0118_50_lillie/2501_0702_03_10": "Hmm... That doesn’t quite fit, does it? I suppose\nmy cute Lunala’s just always going to be Lunala\nto me!",
    "ch0118_50_lillie/2511_0701_01_10": "In the past, I used to hate the idea of Pokémon\nbattling and getting hurt.",
    "ch0118_50_lillie/2511_0701_02_10": "But as long as I’m brave enough to step up when\nthey need protection, I think it’s important to push\nforward—even when things look tough.",
    "ch0118_50_lillie/2511_0702_01_10": "I have to believe in my friends, after all. That’s\none way to build a bond with each other.",
    "ch0118_50_lillie/2511_0702_02_10": "That’s something I learned from another Trainer I\nknow...and also from watching you!",
    "ch0118_50_lillie/3001_0701_01_10": "Good morning! I’m always excited for the start of\na new day!",
    "ch0118_50_lillie/3003_0701_01_10": "Hi! Every day is a special day for someone.\nJust thinking about that makes me really happy!",
    "ch0118_50_lillie/3005_0701_01_10": "Good evening! The sun’s gone down, and the\nmoon is rising... Maybe I should get to bed soon.",
