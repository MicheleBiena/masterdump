    "charaepi_ch0038_00_hyouta/2301_1201_0300_10": "I was just trying to imagine how I would\nhave dug out this area if it were me.",
    "charaepi_ch0038_00_hyouta/2301_0301_0400_10": "What do you mean?",
    "charaepi_ch0038_00_hyouta/2301_0401_0500_10": "Well, I like drawing up plans and blueprints\nin my head for digging up caves and things.\nIt’s fun!",

    "charaepi_ch0038_00_hyouta/2301_1201_0800_10": "I wonder what the person who built this\nartificial island was thinking when\nthey dug out these caves.",
    "charaepi_ch0038_00_hyouta/2301_1201_0900_10": "If it were me, I think I would have turned\nthese caves into a giant tunnel system that\ncould transport people all over the island.",
    "charaepi_ch0038_00_hyouta/2301_0301_1000_10": "That sounds amazing!",
    "charaepi_ch0038_00_hyouta/2301_0401_1100_10": "Hehe, thanks. But if a tunnel’s gonna be\nused by that many people, the builders\nhave to make sure it’s completely safe.",
    "charaepi_ch0038_00_hyouta/2301_0302_1200_10": "I see!",
    "charaepi_ch0038_00_hyouta/2301_0402_1300_10": "Of course, if a tunnel’s gonna be\nused by that many people, the builders\nhave to make sure it’s completely safe.",

    "charaepi_ch0038_00_hyouta/2301_1201_1500_10": "Imagine how much happiness a tunnel\nlike that could bring to people!",
    "charaepi_ch0038_00_hyouta/2301_1201_1600_10": "Plus, if I’m excavating that much ground,\nI’m bound to find all sorts of cool, rare fossils\nalong the way!",
    "charaepi_ch0038_00_hyouta/2301_1201_1700_10": "Fossil collecting is my life’s work, you know!\nDigging up enough of them to open my own\nmuseum has always been a dream of mine.",
    "charaepi_ch0038_00_hyouta/2301_1201_1800_10": "Ideally, I’d build a whole underground city\nand open up the museum there! Sounds like\nsomething out of an epic movie, right?",
    "charaepi_ch0038_00_hyouta/2301_1201_1900_10": "I’d have tons of ultra-rare fossils on display—\nones you can’t find anywhere else!\nI’m sure it would be fun for visitors...",
    "charaepi_ch0038_00_hyouta/2301_1201_2000_10": "but it’s just a silly dream, after all.\nI’m sure it’ll never happen. \nYou probably think I’m crazy, don’t you?",
    "charaepi_ch0038_00_hyouta/2301_0301_2100_10": "I bet you could do it, Roark!",
    "charaepi_ch0038_00_hyouta/2301_0401_2200_10": "You really think so?\nThanks...for supporting my dream.",

    "charaepi_ch0038_00_hyouta/2301_1201_2600_10": "But hearing you say that just now gave me\ncourage. I think I want to keep chasing\nmy dream, [Name:PlayerNickname ].",
    "charaepi_ch0038_00_hyouta/2301_0301_2700_10": "“Again”? You’ve given up \non your dream before?",
    "charaepi_ch0038_00_hyouta/2301_0401_2800_10": "It was a long time ago, but yes.\nI had just finished building my first tunnel\never...and the very next day, it collapsed.",
    "charaepi_ch0038_00_hyouta/2301_0302_2900_10": "What do you mean?",
    "charaepi_ch0038_00_hyouta/2301_0402_3000_10": "Well, I almost gave it up once, a long time ago.\nI had just finished building my first tunnel\never...and the very next day, it collapsed.",
    "charaepi_ch0038_00_hyouta/2301_1201_3100_10": "I was in shock... I’d reviewed my blueprints\nover and over and built the tunnel to the best \nof my ability. I was confident it was safe!",
    "charaepi_ch0038_00_hyouta/2301_1201_3200_10": "But I failed. The fact that the tunnel collapsed\ndespite how hard I’d worked felt like a sign\nthat maybe digging wasn’t for me after all.",
    "charaepi_ch0038_00_hyouta/2301_1201_3300_10": "I kept dwelling on those thoughts,\nand I came really close to giving up...",
    "charaepi_ch0038_00_hyouta/2301_1201_3400_10": "but then I saw my buddy here smash open\na rock that was said to be unbreakable!",
    "charaepi_ch0038_00_hyouta/2301_1201_3500_10": "Cranidos picked up a rock and body-slammed\nthe supposedly unbreakable rock with it,\nand it smashed right open!",
    "charaepi_ch0038_00_hyouta/2301_1201_3600_10": "I had never thought to do that before.\nThat day, Cranidos taught me that there’s\nnever just one way to do things.",
    "charaepi_ch0038_00_hyouta/2301_1201_3700_10": "It seems like both you and Cranidos taught me\nanother lesson today.",
    "charaepi_ch0038_00_hyouta/2301_1201_3800_10": "No matter how crazy and outlandish my dream\nmay seem, as long as I never give up, I may\nthink of a way to make it a reality someday!",
    "charaepi_ch0038_00_hyouta/2301_1201_3900_10": "I’ll have to learn how to think outside\nthe box and become more resourceful,\njust like my partner here!",
    "charaepi_ch0038_00_hyouta/2301_1201_4000_10": "I’ll still be Roark the Rock!\nMy willpower will still be unbreakable!",
    "charaepi_ch0038_00_hyouta/2301_1201_4100_10": "I just need to break out of my box\nand think more unconventionally!",
    "charaepi_ch0038_00_hyouta/2311_1201_0100_10": "Ah, hello Roark! I came here for fossil excavation,\nbut I’ve been rather unlucky so far...",
    "charaepi_ch0038_00_hyouta/2311_1201_0200_10": "Yeah, that’s understandable. This site was made\njust like an authentic dig site, after all! The trick is\nto not give up and just keep digging.",
    "charaepi_ch0038_00_hyouta/2311_1201_0300_10": "All of the fossils you can find here had originally\nbeen hiding in the earth for tens of thousands\nof years before they were brought to Pasio.",
    "charaepi_ch0038_00_hyouta/2311_1201_0400_10": "Maybe they’re trying not to be found a\nsecond time...",
    "charaepi_ch0038_00_hyouta/2311_1201_0500_10": "You say that...but it seems like your Cranidos has\nfound a lot of fossils.",
    "charaepi_ch0038_00_hyouta/2311_1201_0600_10": "Well, he does always dig with me, whether it’s\nin a mine or a fossil dig site.",
    "charaepi_ch0038_00_hyouta/2311_1201_0700_10": "Thanks to that, he’s gotten pretty tough!\nHow about if we take a little break and have us\na Pokémon battle?",
    "charaepi_ch0038_00_hyouta/2311_0101_0100_10": "I accept your challenge! I may not have had luck\nwith the fossils, but I won’t need luck in a\nPokémon battle!",
    "charaepi_ch0038_00_hyouta/2311_0101_0200_10": "All right! You’ll see how strong digging every day\nhas made us!",
    "charaepi_ch0038_00_hyouta/2311_0501_0100_10": "I can’t believe I lost...",
    "charaepi_ch0038_00_hyouta/2311_0501_0200_10": "But such power... Your attacks would probably\nallow you to pulverize an entire mineshaft on\nyour own!",
    "charaepi_ch0038_00_hyouta/2311_0501_0300_10": "You guys were really tough! There were a few\nmoments where I thought we might not be able to\nbreak through your defense!",
    "charaepi_ch0038_00_hyouta/2311_0501_0400_10": "Hm? What’s up Cranidos? Wait, was that battle\nenough to make you evolve?!",
    "charaepi_ch0038_00_hyouta/2311_0501_0500_10": "Thanks, Roxanne! Cranidos was able to get even\nstronger, thanks to you!",
