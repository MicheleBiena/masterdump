    "episode_event_general_autumn_2021/6701_1001_0500_10": "He looks a bit worried, though... Maybe we should\ngo talk to him!",
    "episode_event_general_autumn_2021/6701_1001_0600_10": "Um... Hullo! Need any help?",
    "episode_event_general_autumn_2021/6701_1001_0700_10": "... ... ...!",
    "episode_event_general_autumn_2021/6701_1001_0800_10": "Hmm... That Snorlax over there is yours, isn’t it?\nIt looks like it might be hungry.",

    "episode_event_general_autumn_2021/6701_1001_1000_10": "I knew it!",
    "episode_event_general_autumn_2021/6701_1001_1100_10": "That’s impressive, Mallow! Leave it to a chef\nto know when someone needs a meal!",
    "episode_event_general_autumn_2021/6701_1001_1200_10": "... ... ...",
    "episode_event_general_autumn_2021/6701_1001_1300_10": "Have you ran out of snacks to give your Snorlax?",
    "episode_event_general_autumn_2021/6701_1001_1400_10": "That makes sense! Snorlax are famous for being\nbig eaters!",
    "episode_event_general_autumn_2021/6701_1001_1500_10": "Yeah! I read in my Pokédex that it’s not satisfied\nunless it eats over 880 pounds of food a day!",
    "episode_event_general_autumn_2021/6701_1001_1600_10": "I see... So that’s why you’re here looking\nfor mushrooms!",

    "episode_event_general_autumn_2021/6701_1001_1800_10": "But...I’m guessing you aren’t finding enough\nmushrooms to feed Snorlax?",

    "episode_event_general_autumn_2021/6701_1001_2000_10": "But finding Berries is a little different from\nmushroom hunting... Maybe that’s what you’re\nhaving trouble with?",
    "episode_event_general_autumn_2021/6701_1001_2100_10": "I’ve got an idea! Why don’t we give them some of\nthe mushrooms we’ve picked?",
    "episode_event_general_autumn_2021/6701_1001_2200_10": "Good idea! We picked a whole bunch, and it’s\nimportant to share the bounty that nature\nprovides us!",
    "episode_event_general_autumn_2021/6701_1001_2300_10": "Yeah! Plus, being hungry is no fun at all. I know\nwhat that can be like...",
    "episode_event_general_autumn_2021/6701_1001_2400_10": "Snorlax doesn’t even look close to being full yet.",
    "episode_event_general_autumn_2021/6701_1001_2500_10": "And we ended up feeding it our entire stash...",
    "episode_event_general_autumn_2021/6701_1001_2600_10": "No problem! We’ll just have to go searching for\nmore mushrooms, then!",
    "episode_event_general_autumn_2021/6701_1001_2700_10": "Yeah! And I bet if we asked some sync pairs with\nmushroom-like Pokémon...",
    "episode_event_general_autumn_2021/6701_1001_2800_10": "They’d know some spots where we could find a\nwhole bunch of them? Great thinking!",
    "episode_event_general_autumn_2021/6701_1001_2900_10": "My guess is we might get challenged to some\nbattles along the way, so we should be prepared\nfor that.",
    "episode_event_general_autumn_2021/6701_1001_3000_10": "... ... ...!",
    "episode_event_general_autumn_2021/6701_1001_3100_10": "No need to thank us, Red! How could we let a\nPokémon go hungry?",
    "episode_event_general_autumn_2021/6701_1001_3200_10": "Let’s feed Snorlax till he’s so stuffed, he can’t eat\nanother bite!",
