    "charaepi_ch0021_00_green/2301_1201_0200_10": "Bonjour!",
    "charaepi_ch0021_00_green/2301_1201_0300_10": "I was atop the arena when I saw you walking,\nso I thought I would come down to talk to you!",
    "charaepi_ch0021_00_green/2301_0301_0400_10": "You were on top of the arena?",
    "charaepi_ch0021_00_green/2301_0401_0500_10": "Yeah, the best way to get the lay of the land is\nto get a good look from as high as you can get.",
    "charaepi_ch0021_00_green/2301_0302_0600_10": "Isn’t that dangerous?",
    "charaepi_ch0021_00_green/2301_0402_0700_10": "Nah. Plus, the best way to get \nthe lay of the land is to get a good look \nfrom as high as you can get.",
    "charaepi_ch0021_00_green/2301_1201_0800_10": "Pidgeot can fly at Mach 2.",
    "charaepi_ch0021_00_green/2301_1201_0900_10": "Not only that, but he can pinpoint a Magikarp\na thousand meters below him.",
    "charaepi_ch0021_00_green/2301_1201_1000_10": "High places are Pidgeot’s territory, to the degree\nthat he and I might spend more time in the skies\nthan on land.",
    "charaepi_ch0021_00_green/2301_1201_1100_10": "Yeah, you got that right.",
    "charaepi_ch0021_00_green/2301_1201_1200_10": "We’ve been all over the world, \nbut Pasio really is a nice place.",
    "charaepi_ch0021_00_green/2301_0301_1300_10": "It’s really pretty.",
    "charaepi_ch0021_00_green/2301_0401_1400_10": "Yeah, while Pidgeot and I were flying around,\nwe saw firsthand how pretty the island is.",
    "charaepi_ch0021_00_green/2301_0401_1500_10": "It shows how well this artificial island is able\nto blend into nature.",
    "charaepi_ch0021_00_green/2301_0302_1600_10": "It’s really bustling.",
    "charaepi_ch0021_00_green/2301_0402_1700_10": "Sure is. There are Trainers and their Pokémon\ngathered here from all over the world.",
    "charaepi_ch0021_00_green/2301_0402_1800_10": "We have plenty of people to battle, too, \nso that’s also a plus.",
    "charaepi_ch0021_00_green/2301_1201_1900_10": "It’s pretty much a paradise for Trainers\nand Pokémon!",
    "charaepi_ch0021_00_green/2301_1201_2500_10": "I’ve got this rival, Red.\nYou’ve seen him around, right?",
    "charaepi_ch0021_00_green/2301_1201_2600_10": "You kinda remind me of him!",
    "charaepi_ch0021_00_green/2301_1201_2700_10": "You’re like a crimson flame quietly burning.",
    "charaepi_ch0021_00_green/2301_1201_2800_10": "But even though you’re on the quiet side, you’re\nhiding some awesome power, too, right?",
    "charaepi_ch0021_00_green/2301_0301_2900_10": "I wouldn’t say that...",
    "charaepi_ch0021_00_green/2301_0401_3000_10": "Nah, even Pidgeot thinks so.",
    "charaepi_ch0021_00_green/2301_0302_3100_10": "You might be right.",
    "charaepi_ch0021_00_green/2301_0402_3200_10": "No, I’m sure of it. Pidgeot agrees, too.",
    "charaepi_ch0021_00_green/2301_1201_3300_10": "That’s why I have to take you down\nmyself someday!",
    "charaepi_ch0021_00_green/2301_1201_3400_10": "OK... Maybe that came out a bit strong.",
    "charaepi_ch0021_00_green/2301_1201_3500_10": "But anyway, I’m traveling around the world so\nthat I can get even one step closer to being the\nabsolute best.",
    "charaepi_ch0021_00_green/2301_1201_3600_10": "Right now, I don’t think I’d lose to either you\nor Red!",
    "charaepi_ch0021_00_green/2301_1201_3700_10": "What? Don’t be overconfident?\nCome on, Pidgeot...",
    "charaepi_ch0021_00_green/2301_1201_3800_10": "How am I supposed to keep my feet on the\nground if I’m flying high with you, buddy?",
    "charaepi_ch0021_00_green/2301_0301_3900_10": "I’ll blast you out of the sky!",
    "charaepi_ch0021_00_green/2301_0401_4000_10": "Ooh, looks like somebody can talk big! I like it!",
    "charaepi_ch0021_00_green/2301_0302_4100_10": "I’ll fly just as high and catch you!",
    "charaepi_ch0021_00_green/2301_0402_4200_10": "Ooh, looks like somebody can talk big! I like it!",
    "charaepi_ch0021_00_green/2301_1201_4300_10": "But if you’re gonna try your hand, I’d recommend\nyou try sooner rather than later.",
    "charaepi_ch0021_00_green/2301_1201_4400_10": "We’re as free as the wind, after all.",
    "charaepi_ch0021_00_green/2301_1201_4500_10": "If we get bored, we’ll wander away to who\nknows where next.",
    "charaepi_ch0021_00_green/2301_1201_4600_10": "You’re the same, too, aren’t you? I can tell.",
