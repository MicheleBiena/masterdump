    "ch0148_00_matsuba/0601_0702_02_10": "You know, if you put your nose to the grindstone\nand train until you grow really strong...",
    "ch0148_00_matsuba/0601_0702_03_10": "someday you might find yourself face-to-face\nwith a Legendary Pokémon!",
    "ch0148_00_matsuba/0602_0701_01_10": "Suicune, Entei, and Raikou are the subject of\nlegend in Ecruteak City.",
    "ch0148_00_matsuba/0602_0701_02_10": "I have this old friend Eusine who’s just enchanted\nhead over heels with Suicune.",
    "ch0148_00_matsuba/0602_0701_03_10": "Personally, I’d have to say I like Entei best...but\nI can’t leave out Raikou... Guess I can’t make up\nmy mind.",
    "ch0148_00_matsuba/0602_0701_04_10": "If you ever have the pleasure of meeting them, I’d\nbe curious to hear which one you like best!",
    "ch0148_00_matsuba/0602_0702_01_10": "You know, I once saw Entei. I mean like up close.",
    "ch0148_00_matsuba/0602_0702_02_10": "I’ll never forget its eyes. It was like it could\nsee right through me, down into the depths\nof my heart.",

    "ch0148_00_matsuba/0603_0702_01_10": "I hear some people find the Ecruteak Gym\na little scary.",
    "ch0148_00_matsuba/0603_0702_02_10": "Perhaps I should brighten up the entryway with\na nice flower arrangement or something...",
    "ch0148_00_matsuba/0604_0701_01_10": "My whole life, I’ve been so focused on training.",
    "ch0148_00_matsuba/0604_0701_02_10": "Until I arrived on Pasio, I practically never had\nthe chance to interact with so many people.",
    "ch0148_00_matsuba/0604_0701_03_10": "Thanks to meeting all these sync pairs, I’ve\nbegun to see something that I’d never been\nable to see before...",
    "ch0148_00_matsuba/0604_0701_04_10": "The warmth that bonds people and Pokémon with\none another!",

    "ch0148_00_matsuba/0605_0701_01_10": "Listen, [Name:PlayerNickname ].\nWhatever hardships you meet on the path ahead,\ndon’t you give up.",
    "ch0148_00_matsuba/0605_0701_02_10": "Even if it feels like your goals and beliefs are\ngetting further away. Even if you know you won’t\nget a second chance at them.",
    "ch0148_00_matsuba/0605_0701_03_10": "No matter what setback comes your way, the\npower to overcome it and keep moving forward\nrests with you and you alone.",

    "ch0148_00_matsuba/0605_0702_03_10": "I will continue my training until I discover a new\nfuture for me.",
    "ch0148_00_matsuba/1701_0701_01_10": "Oh, good timing. Here, I want you to have this.",
    "ch0148_00_matsuba/1701_0701_02_10": "Go ahead and use it, if it tickles your fancy.",
    "ch0148_00_matsuba/1701_0702_01_10": "It feels nice to give and receive gifts.",

    "ch0148_00_matsuba/2501_0702_02_10": "It’s kind of endearing how your hand passes\nthrough when you try to pet them.",
    "ch0148_00_matsuba/2511_0701_01_10": "As Gym Leaders, it’s part of our job to award\nbadges to Trainers who’ve proven their skill.",
    "ch0148_00_matsuba/2511_0701_02_10": "It feels good to do so, since you’ve had the\npleasure of encountering a promising Trainer.",
    "ch0148_00_matsuba/2511_0701_03_10": "But that doesn’t quite take away the bitter taste of\ndefeat. Especially when we’re supposed to have\nmore discipline than anyone else...",
    "ch0148_00_matsuba/2511_0701_04_10": "It’s complicated. I bet all Gym Leaders have\nwrestled with these feelings in some form.",
    "ch0148_00_matsuba/2511_0702_01_10": "If you ever make it over to Johto, you should come\nby the Ecruteak Gym for a battle!",
    "ch0148_00_matsuba/2511_0702_02_10": "You’re an excellent Trainer. I can see you’re just\nbrimming with all sorts of possibilities.",
    "ch0148_00_matsuba/2511_0702_03_10": "I get the feeling you’ll be able to overcome the\nbarrier I present to you and ascend to even\ngreater heights.",
    "ch0148_00_matsuba/2511_0702_04_10": "But don’t expect it to be easy! I’ll come at you\nwith all I’ve got!",
    "ch0148_00_matsuba/3001_0701_01_10": "Mornings are perfect for meditation.",
    "ch0148_00_matsuba/3002_0701_01_10": "Ecruteak City’s famous for the Bell Tower.\nWhat would Pasio’s signature landmark be?\nThere are so many to choose from...",
    "ch0148_00_matsuba/3003_0701_01_10": "Volcanoes, glaciers, you name it. Pasio has so\nmany different terrains, I can never make up my\nmind on where to train.",
    "ch0148_00_matsuba/3004_0701_01_10": "Pasio is definitely lively, but I prefer the vibe in\nEcruteak City a bit more.",
    "ch0148_00_matsuba/3005_0701_01_10": "What’s that following you?! Pasio isn’t supposed to\nhave any wild Pokémon, right?",
    "ch0148_00_matsuba/3006_0701_01_10": "My partner Pokémon and I are more active at\nnight, but don’t push yourself to keep up with us\nif you’re tired, all right?",
