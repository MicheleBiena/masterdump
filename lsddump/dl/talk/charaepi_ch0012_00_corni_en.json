    "charaepi_ch0012_00_corni/2301_1201_0200_10": "Lucario told me he’s feeling a little\ncurious about your aura.",
    "charaepi_ch0012_00_corni/2301_1201_0800_10": "Right now, it seems like he’s curious about\nthe bond you share with your Pokémon.\nHow strong it is.",
    "charaepi_ch0012_00_corni/2301_0301_0900_10": "You two seem really close!",
    "charaepi_ch0012_00_corni/2301_0401_1000_10": "Yep! We sure are! Did you know that Lucario\nunderstands us when we talk to him?",
    "charaepi_ch0012_00_corni/2301_0302_1100_10": "Can Lucario understand what\nwe’re saying?",
    "charaepi_ch0012_00_corni/2301_0402_1200_10": "Actually, Lucario can understand ANYONE who\ntalks to him! Isn’t that cool?",
    "charaepi_ch0012_00_corni/2301_1201_1300_10": "Although, back then, with Riolu...",
    "charaepi_ch0012_00_corni/2301_1201_1400_10": "Oh! I mean Lucario—or Riolu, before he\nevolved into Lucario.",
    "charaepi_ch0012_00_corni/2301_1201_1500_10": "Anyway, back then, I didn’t really connect with\nRiolu at all.",
    "charaepi_ch0012_00_corni/2301_0301_1600_10": "Really?",
    "charaepi_ch0012_00_corni/2301_0401_1700_10": "It’s kinda embarrassing to talk about since it’s\nbeen so long, but I guess I might as well tell\nthe story now!",
    "charaepi_ch0012_00_corni/2301_0302_1800_10": "I never would have guessed.",
    "charaepi_ch0012_00_corni/2301_0402_1900_10": "It’s kinda embarrassing to talk about since it’s\nbeen so long, but I guess I might as well tell\nthe story now!",
    "charaepi_ch0012_00_corni/2301_1201_2000_10": "So, when I was a little girl, I met Riolu\nand we decided to train together.",
    "charaepi_ch0012_00_corni/2301_1201_2100_10": "Since I’m successor to the Key Stones,\nwhich you need to Mega Evolve a Pokémon...",
    "charaepi_ch0012_00_corni/2301_1201_2200_10": "I knew I had to form a strong bond of friendship\nwith Riolu so that he could evolve into Lucario\nand eventually Mega Lucario one day.",
    "charaepi_ch0012_00_corni/2301_1201_2300_10": "My grandpa gave me some good advice.\nHe told me that dancing is perfect for learning\nhow to trust and connect with your Pokémon.",
    "charaepi_ch0012_00_corni/2301_1201_2400_10": "It makes sense, right? If you can’t connect\nwith your dance partner, you’ll fall out of\nsync and fumble your footwork!",
    "charaepi_ch0012_00_corni/2301_1201_2500_10": "But I was actually really bad at that!",
    "charaepi_ch0012_00_corni/2301_1201_2600_10": "Riolu was amazing at dancing, and he\nwas able to match all of my moves perfectly...",
    "charaepi_ch0012_00_corni/2301_1201_2700_10": "but when I saw how good he was,\nI wanted to show that I was even better!\nSo...I got a little overzealous.",
    "charaepi_ch0012_00_corni/2301_1201_2800_10": "Despite the fact that Riolu was doing his\nbest to match my dance moves...",
    "charaepi_ch0012_00_corni/2301_1201_2900_10": "I was actually way off, so the two of us\nended up totally out of sync.",
    "charaepi_ch0012_00_corni/2301_1201_3000_10": "My grandpa was pretty appalled, as you can\nprobably imagine! ",
    "charaepi_ch0012_00_corni/2301_0301_3100_10": "I’m sure it happens all the time.",
    "charaepi_ch0012_00_corni/2301_0401_3200_10": "Well, it was kinda like that for a while.\nThen one day, my legs got kinda tangled up\nwhen we were practicing our dance steps...",
    "charaepi_ch0012_00_corni/2301_0302_3300_10": "What happened after that?!",
    "charaepi_ch0012_00_corni/2301_0402_3400_10": "Well, it was kinda like that for a while.\nThen one day, my legs got kinda tangled up\nwhen we were practicing our dance steps...",
    "charaepi_ch0012_00_corni/2301_1201_3500_10": "I thought I was gonna do a face-plant, but Riolu\nleaped in front of me and saved me from the fall!",
    "charaepi_ch0012_00_corni/2301_1201_3600_10": "He put my safety above his own, even though\nhe could easily have been injured doing that.",
    "charaepi_ch0012_00_corni/2301_1201_3700_10": "And that’s when I realized...\nUp until that point, I hadn’t been trying\nto connect with Riolu at all.",
    "charaepi_ch0012_00_corni/2301_1201_3800_10": "How could I expect to get closer to him\nif I wasn’t even doing my part?",
    "charaepi_ch0012_00_corni/2301_1201_3900_10": "After I realized that, both my dance moves\nand my connection with Riolu became\nso much more in sync!",
    "charaepi_ch0012_00_corni/2301_0301_4000_10": "I’m glad it turned out OK!",
    "charaepi_ch0012_00_corni/2301_0401_4100_10": "Thanks! We’re so proud of the perfect sync we\nhave now, but it probably wouldn’t have been\npossible if we hadn’t made those early mistakes!",
    "charaepi_ch0012_00_corni/2301_0302_4200_10": "And now you’re a perfect combo!",
    "charaepi_ch0012_00_corni/2301_0402_4300_10": "Thanks! We’re so proud of the perfect sync we\nhave now, but it probably wouldn’t have been\npossible if we hadn’t made those early mistakes!",
    "charaepi_ch0012_00_corni/2301_1201_4400_10": "Oh, that reminds me! Our super-special move\ncame out of that whole experience as well!\nOur deadly rolling axe-kick!",
    "charaepi_ch0012_00_corni/2301_1201_4500_10": "We might have to go visit you in the hospital if\nyou ever get hit with that... Haha! Just teasing!",
