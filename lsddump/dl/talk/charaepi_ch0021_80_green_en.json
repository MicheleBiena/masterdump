    "charaepi_ch0021_80_green/2301_1201_0200_10": "Props for challenging me, guys. But today just\nwasn’t your lucky day.",
    "charaepi_ch0021_80_green/2301_1201_0300_10": "Oh, [Name:PlayerNickname ]! Were you\nwatching me battle just now?",
    "charaepi_ch0021_80_green/2301_0301_0400_10": "It was awesome!",
    "charaepi_ch0021_80_green/2301_0401_0500_10": "You don’t have to be so dramatic. But thanks,\nI guess!",
    "charaepi_ch0021_80_green/2301_0302_0600_10": "It was shocking!",
    "charaepi_ch0021_80_green/2301_0402_0700_10": "I bet it was. Had to give ’em a little taste of what\nI can really do, know what I mean?",
    "charaepi_ch0021_80_green/2301_1201_0800_10": "Hey, wanna know my secret to getting stronger?\nI bet you’d catch on pretty quick.",
    "charaepi_ch0021_80_green/2301_1201_0900_10": "First, you have to remember why you became a\nTrainer in the first place. Don’t ever forget that.",
    "charaepi_ch0021_80_green/2301_1201_1000_10": "Also, a sync pair is only as strong as their bond,\nso you have to trust your partner—and earn their\nlove and trust, too.",
    "charaepi_ch0021_80_green/2301_1201_1100_10": "And last but not least, you need a good rival!",
    "charaepi_ch0021_80_green/2301_1201_1200_10": "Red and I have been rivals for ages, so we’re\nboth where we are now because of each other.",
    "charaepi_ch0021_80_green/2301_1201_1300_10": "Red’s the best at what he does. So as his rival, I\nhave to be the best, too.",
    "charaepi_ch0021_80_green/2301_1201_1400_10": "Does that make sense?",
    "charaepi_ch0021_80_green/2301_0301_1500_10": "Yeah!",
    "charaepi_ch0021_80_green/2301_0401_1600_10": "Heh, you must already have a pretty good rival of\nyour own, then.",
    "charaepi_ch0021_80_green/2301_0302_1700_10": "I dunno...",
    "charaepi_ch0021_80_green/2301_0402_1800_10": "That just means you haven’t found a good rival\nyet. I’m sure if you look around, you’ll find a ton\nof candidates, though!",
    "charaepi_ch0021_80_green/2301_1201_1900_10": "*chuckle* Oh, really? Rivals, huh?",
    "charaepi_ch0021_80_green/2301_1201_2000_10": "As far as I can tell, you didn’t really pay that\nmuch attention to anyone but yourself back then.",
    "charaepi_ch0021_80_green/2301_1201_2100_10": "L-Leaf?!",
    "charaepi_ch0021_80_green/2301_1201_2200_10": "And weren’t you the one who got too cocky and\nsaid “I am the most powerful Trainer in the\nworld!” when you were Champion? ",
    "charaepi_ch0021_80_green/2301_1201_2300_10": "Er...I mean, I guess I might’ve said something\nalong those lines...",
    "charaepi_ch0021_80_green/2301_1201_2400_10": "But I lost to Red soon after, and that’s when I\nrealized I had to change.",
    "charaepi_ch0021_80_green/2301_1201_2500_10": "That’s true... You did change.",
    "charaepi_ch0021_80_green/2301_1201_2600_10": "And you know, I think Aerodactyl can keep up\nwith your tough training because he feels that you\nlove and trust him a lot!",
    "charaepi_ch0021_80_green/2301_1201_2700_10": "Heh... I sure hope he does!",
    "charaepi_ch0021_80_green/2301_1201_2800_10": "I actually wanted to explore more of Kanto\ntogether with Aerodactyl, but I kind of struggled\nraising him back then.",
    "charaepi_ch0021_80_green/2301_1201_2900_10": "I think it’s probably because I wasn’t ready to\nhandle him at the time.",
    "charaepi_ch0021_80_green/2301_1201_3000_10": "But now, I think I am! And that’s why I chose him\nas my partner Pokémon!",
    "charaepi_ch0021_80_green/2301_1201_3100_10": "I also chose this outfit because I want to\nremember how I felt back then.",
    "charaepi_ch0021_80_green/2301_1201_3200_10": "Oh, but don’t worry... I don’t plan on\nlosing this time.",
    "charaepi_ch0021_80_green/2301_1201_3300_10": "I’m gonna reclaim my title of world’s strongest\nTrainer together with Aerodactyl! Anyone who\ndisagrees can step right up and challenge us!",
    "charaepi_ch0021_80_green/2301_1201_3400_10": "Well, I don’t plan on losing to you, either!\nAnd also...",
    "charaepi_ch0021_80_green/2301_1201_3500_10": "Heh... You’re looking pretty confident, too.",
    "charaepi_ch0021_80_green/2301_1201_3600_10": "Perfect! Let’s have a battle! I’ll take you all down\nat once!",
