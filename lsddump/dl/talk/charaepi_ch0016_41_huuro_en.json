    "charaepi_ch0016_41_huuro/2301_1201_0300_10": "I can feel it... I feel the power of the wind as it\nbreathes around us.",
    "charaepi_ch0016_41_huuro/2301_1101_0400_20": "Just as [Name:PlayerNickname ] was about to\ncall out to them, a gust of wind rushed through\nthe air.",
    "charaepi_ch0016_41_huuro/2301_1201_0500_10": "Time to fly, Tornadus!",
    "charaepi_ch0016_41_huuro/2301_1201_0600_10": "Let’s go, Pelipper!",

    "charaepi_ch0016_41_huuro/2301_1201_0900_10": "Yeah, absolutely! I’m so glad I got to fly with you!",
    "charaepi_ch0016_41_huuro/2301_1201_1000_10": "Oh, [Name:PlayerNickname ]! Nice to see you!",

    "charaepi_ch0016_41_huuro/2301_0401_1200_10": "The wind was so nice, I went flying with Winona!",
    "charaepi_ch0016_41_huuro/2301_0401_1300_10": "I ran into her earlier. I guess the wind brought us\nto the same place!",
    "charaepi_ch0016_41_huuro/2301_0302_1400_10": "Are you and Winona good friends?",
    "charaepi_ch0016_41_huuro/2301_0402_1500_10": "Yeah! We understand each other, without even\nhaving to say anything!",
    "charaepi_ch0016_41_huuro/2301_1201_1600_10": "I guess it’s because people who like to fly are\nthe intuitive, free-spirited types!",
    "charaepi_ch0016_41_huuro/2301_1201_1700_10": "Now that I think about it, meeting Tornadus\nwas kinda the same, too!",

    "charaepi_ch0016_41_huuro/2301_0401_1900_10": "Well... I guess it wasn’t the typical “Hey, nice to\nmeet ya!” kind of deal.",
    "charaepi_ch0016_41_huuro/2301_0302_2000_10": "It must’ve been a\nwhirlwind encounter!",
    "charaepi_ch0016_41_huuro/2301_0402_2100_10": "Sure was! I’d even say it was a bit dramatic!",
    "charaepi_ch0016_41_huuro/2301_1201_2200_10": "The morning I met Tornadus, I heard about some\nunusual weather from another pilot.",
    "charaepi_ch0016_41_huuro/2301_1201_2300_10": "Apparently, there was some kind of disturbance\nmaking the weather unstable at the time.",
    "charaepi_ch0016_41_huuro/2301_1201_2400_10": "So I tried to be careful when I went flying\nthat day!",
    "charaepi_ch0016_41_huuro/2301_1201_2500_10": "Sure enough, the weather suddenly turned into a\nnasty storm, and I caught the brunt of it.",
    "charaepi_ch0016_41_huuro/2301_1201_2600_10": "I thought of flying right back home at first, but\neveryone needed help because the storms\nwere damaging their crops!",
    "charaepi_ch0016_41_huuro/2301_1201_2700_10": "So I decided to keep on flying to see what was\nmaking the weather so unstable.",
    "charaepi_ch0016_41_huuro/2301_1201_2800_10": "That’s when I found Tornadus, right in the\neye of that storm.",
    "charaepi_ch0016_41_huuro/2301_0301_2900_10": "That’s how you met?",
    "charaepi_ch0016_41_huuro/2301_0401_3000_10": "Yep! But we weren’t best friends right off the bat.",
    "charaepi_ch0016_41_huuro/2301_0302_3100_10": "That’s how you became friends?",
    "charaepi_ch0016_41_huuro/2301_0402_3200_10": "Yep! It didn’t happen right off the bat, though.",
    "charaepi_ch0016_41_huuro/2301_1201_3300_10": "Tornadus kept kicking up these huge storms.",
    "charaepi_ch0016_41_huuro/2301_1201_3400_10": "I wanted to stop him from doing that, so I\nkept flying every time he started a storm!",
    "charaepi_ch0016_41_huuro/2301_1201_3500_10": "Somehow, we got to understand each other better\nas we flew through all those storms.",
    "charaepi_ch0016_41_huuro/2301_1201_3600_10": "Before I knew it, we were always hanging out\ntogether, like we do now!",
    "charaepi_ch0016_41_huuro/2301_1201_3700_10": "Somehow, it just became natural to be together!",
    "charaepi_ch0016_41_huuro/2301_0301_3800_10": "So the storms brought you together!",
    "charaepi_ch0016_41_huuro/2301_0401_3900_10": "Hehe! That might be it!",
    "charaepi_ch0016_41_huuro/2301_0302_4000_10": "That’s an interesting way to meet\na Pokémon!",
    "charaepi_ch0016_41_huuro/2301_0402_4100_10": "Right? That’s what makes first-time encounters\nso exciting!",
    "charaepi_ch0016_41_huuro/2301_1201_4200_10": "You should let the wind guide you sometimes, too!",
    "charaepi_ch0016_41_huuro/2301_1201_4300_10": "You never know... It might lead you to a\nnew friend!",
