    "charaepi_ch0018_00_chris/2301_1201_0300_10": "Heh heh heh. I guess Berries are no problem\nfor you, Totodile, with the way your teeth crunch\nthrough everything!",
    "charaepi_ch0018_00_chris/2301_0301_0400_10": "You look like you’re having fun!",
    "charaepi_ch0018_00_chris/2301_0401_0500_10": "Yeah, observing Totodile like this is so much fun!",
    "charaepi_ch0018_00_chris/2301_0302_0600_10": "I wouldn’t want to be bitten by her!",

    "charaepi_ch0018_00_chris/2301_0402_0800_10": "And despite Totodile’s funny nature, there’s\nno reason for her to ever change, either.",
    "charaepi_ch0018_00_chris/2301_1201_0900_10": "She’s always been like this, you know.",
    "charaepi_ch0018_00_chris/2301_1201_1000_10": "Ever since we went on our journey. And she\nhasn’t really changed since we came to\nPasio, either.",

    "charaepi_ch0018_00_chris/2301_0301_2000_10": "You want to master battles?",
    "charaepi_ch0018_00_chris/2301_0401_2100_10": "Well, they’re both really interesting fields, so\nI’m having a hard time figuring out which one\nto choose.",

    "charaepi_ch0018_00_chris/2301_0301_3000_10": "Why not ask one of those\nfamous people?",
    "charaepi_ch0018_00_chris/2301_0401_3100_10": "Huh?!",
    "charaepi_ch0018_00_chris/2301_0302_3200_10": "Why not look for that path\nwith Totodile?",
    "charaepi_ch0018_00_chris/2301_0402_3300_10": "Huh?!",
    "charaepi_ch0018_00_chris/2301_1201_3400_10": "Oh, never mind me. This is my problem.\nI should make the decision on my own.",
