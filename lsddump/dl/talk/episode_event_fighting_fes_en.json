    "episode_event_fighting_fes/4001_1001_0300_10": "We’re heading out to do some training so we can\njoin in!",
    "episode_event_fighting_fes/4001_1001_0400_10": "I feel ready for anything! Look, I even got a\nnew outfit!",
    "episode_event_fighting_fes/4001_1001_0500_10": "And together, Marshadow and I won’t lose\nto anyone!",
    "episode_event_fighting_fes/4001_1001_0600_10": "I changed into the uniform I wore when I was\ntraining on the Isle of Armor in Galar!",
    "episode_event_fighting_fes/4001_1001_0700_10": "Oh, right. At Master Mustard’s dojo.",
    "episode_event_fighting_fes/4001_1001_0800_10": "You know him too, Bea? Is he really strong?",
    "episode_event_fighting_fes/4001_1001_0900_10": "Oh my, yes. After all, he used to be Galar’s\nFighting-type Gym Leader, and he’s a\nlegendary former Champion as well.",

    "episode_event_fighting_fes/4001_1001_1200_10": "then Gloria must be pretty amazing, too, since she\ngot personally trained by him!",
    "episode_event_fighting_fes/4001_1001_1300_10": "No, no, I’m nowhere near that level...",
    "episode_event_fighting_fes/4001_1001_1400_10": "By the way, how do you all usually train?",
    "episode_event_fighting_fes/4001_1001_1500_10": "We had some pretty interesting training methods\nat Master Mustard’s place, but I’m curious\nabout yours!",
    "episode_event_fighting_fes/4001_1001_1600_10": "I suppose I just try to battle against as many\ndifferent opponents as I can.",
    "episode_event_fighting_fes/4001_1001_1700_10": "Yup, I also learn from experience! Gotta build up\nthose muscles by using them, you know?",
    "episode_event_fighting_fes/4001_1001_1800_10": "Speaking of which, let’s go and train up!",
    "episode_event_fighting_fes/4201_1031_0100_10": "Right, let’s start\nour training!",
    "episode_event_fighting_fes/4201_1001_0100_10": "Tough training won’t get me down when I’m\nwith you all!",
    "episode_event_fighting_fes/4201_1001_0200_10": "Yeah! Let’s keep pushing ourselves and aiming for\nthe top!",
    "episode_event_fighting_fes/4002_1001_0100_10": "OK! That’s enough for now!",
    "episode_event_fighting_fes/4002_1001_0200_10": "I really worked up a sweat!",
    "episode_event_fighting_fes/4002_1001_0300_10": "Oh, are you on your way back from training, too?",
    "episode_event_fighting_fes/4002_1001_0400_10": "Yes! We sparred against each other a bunch\nof times!",
    "episode_event_fighting_fes/4002_1001_0500_10": "Were you two also training?",
    "episode_event_fighting_fes/4002_1001_0600_10": "Yes. Chuck and I have been toughening each\nother up.",
    "episode_event_fighting_fes/4002_1001_0700_10": "We sparred against one hundred opponents each!",
    "episode_event_fighting_fes/4002_1001_0800_10": "A hundred?!",
    "episode_event_fighting_fes/4002_1001_0900_10": "If you’re truly aiming high, you must stretch\nyourself beyond your limits.",

    "episode_event_fighting_fes/4002_1001_1100_10": "Oh dear... Do you suppose we should have\ntrained more as well?",
    "episode_event_fighting_fes/4002_1001_1200_10": "No need to push yourself too hard.",
    "episode_event_fighting_fes/4002_1001_1300_10": "That’s right! What’s important is to keep up your\ntraining at your own pace!",
    "episode_event_fighting_fes/4002_1001_1400_10": "Exactly.",
    "episode_event_fighting_fes/4002_1001_1500_10": "The point of training isn’t to strain or punish\nyourself but to improve yourself.",
    "episode_event_fighting_fes/4002_1001_1600_10": "So go ahead and rest up now! You could even\neat some reeeally sweet Rage Candy Bars while\nyou do!",
    "episode_event_fighting_fes/4002_1001_1700_10": "Wha?!",
    "episode_event_fighting_fes/4002_1001_1800_10": "Why don’t you have some with us?",
    "episode_event_fighting_fes/4002_1001_1900_10": "Oh, w-we couldn’t impose on you like that...",
    "episode_event_fighting_fes/4002_1001_2000_10": "Don’t worry about it! We’ve got more than enough\nto go around, so eat as much as you like!",
    "episode_event_fighting_fes/4002_1001_2100_10": "Bruno and I are both total suckers for these\ncandy bars!",
    "episode_event_fighting_fes/4002_1001_2200_10": "Well then, if you insist...",
    "episode_event_fighting_fes/4002_1001_2300_10": "Wait a second... I think I’ve discovered the true\nsecret to training!",
    "episode_event_fighting_fes/4002_1001_2400_10": "You’ve just got to eat a lot, move a lot, and sleep\na lot!",
    "episode_event_fighting_fes/4002_1001_2500_10": "Hahaha! Now there’s a unique take!",
    "episode_event_fighting_fes/4002_1001_2600_10": "But it definitely shows a true understanding of\nmartial arts! I’m sure you’ll be very successful!",
    "episode_event_fighting_fes/4002_1001_2700_10": "Thank you! I’ll certainly keep trying!",
    "episode_event_fighting_fes/4002_1001_2800_10": "But just be careful...",
