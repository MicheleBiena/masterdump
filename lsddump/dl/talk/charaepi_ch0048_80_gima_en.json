    "charaepi_ch0048_80_gima/2301_1201_0300_10": "I’m looking forward to the day we match\nwits again.",
    "charaepi_ch0048_80_gima/2301_1201_0400_10": "Well, well. If it isn’t [Name:PlayerNickname ].",
    "charaepi_ch0048_80_gima/2301_0301_0500_10": "You had a battle?",
    "charaepi_ch0048_80_gima/2301_0401_0600_10": "I most certainly did. It wasn’t a Pokémon battle,\nthough.",
    "charaepi_ch0048_80_gima/2301_0302_0700_10": "Bisharp looks happy.",
    "charaepi_ch0048_80_gima/2301_0402_0800_10": "That’s because she hit the jackpot.",
    "charaepi_ch0048_80_gima/2301_1201_0900_10": "Here’s what happened. While we were walking,\nBisharp came across a stone that’s perfect for\nsharpening her blades...",
    "charaepi_ch0048_80_gima/2301_1201_1000_10": "but at the same time, Steven spotted the stone\nand decided that he wanted it as well.",
    "charaepi_ch0048_80_gima/2301_1201_1100_10": "I guess to him, it was some sort of rare stone.",
    "charaepi_ch0048_80_gima/2301_1201_1200_10": "So I proposed settling the matter like gentlemen...\nWith a bet.",
    "charaepi_ch0048_80_gima/2301_1201_1300_10": "It was a very simple bet.",
    "charaepi_ch0048_80_gima/2301_1201_1400_10": "Who would be the next to walk by us on the road,\na boy or a girl?",
    "charaepi_ch0048_80_gima/2301_1201_1500_10": "Steven said that it would be a boy, and Bisharp\nthought it would be a girl. And just like that, we\nhad a bet.",
    "charaepi_ch0048_80_gima/2301_1201_1600_10": "Mere moments later, a male Trainer walked by.",
    "charaepi_ch0048_80_gima/2301_0301_1700_10": "So that was it?",
    "charaepi_ch0048_80_gima/2301_0401_1800_10": "No. You see, there was one small problem.",
    "charaepi_ch0048_80_gima/2301_0302_1900_10": "It wasn’t a girl?",
    "charaepi_ch0048_80_gima/2301_0402_2000_10": "That’s right. It was a male Trainer.",
    "charaepi_ch0048_80_gima/2301_1201_2100_10": "I was just about to shake Steven’s hand and\ncongratulate him on winning the bet when Bisharp\nstopped me.",
    "charaepi_ch0048_80_gima/2301_1201_2200_10": "That took me by surprise, because Bisharp isn’t the\ntype of Pokémon to break her promises.",
    "charaepi_ch0048_80_gima/2301_1201_2300_10": "I knew there had to be some reason why she\nstopped me.",
    "charaepi_ch0048_80_gima/2301_1201_2400_10": "Just then, I noticed something. The Trainer\nhad a partner Pokémon—a Pawniard. And not\nonly that...",
    "charaepi_ch0048_80_gima/2301_1201_2500_10": "but the Pawniard was actually walking in front\nof the Trainer.",
    "charaepi_ch0048_80_gima/2301_1201_2600_10": "Sure enough, I asked the Trainer whether his\nPawniard was male or female, and it turned\nout she was a girl!",
    "charaepi_ch0048_80_gima/2301_0301_2700_10": "How funny!",
    "charaepi_ch0048_80_gima/2301_0401_2800_10": "Yeah. I have to admit, I was amused as well.",
    "charaepi_ch0048_80_gima/2301_0302_2900_10": "Bisharp knew?",
    "charaepi_ch0048_80_gima/2301_0402_3000_10": "It appears that way!",
    "charaepi_ch0048_80_gima/2301_1201_3100_10": "You really can’t tell just from a Pawniard’s\nappearance alone, but Bisharp noticed right away.",
    "charaepi_ch0048_80_gima/2301_1201_3200_10": "I know my Bisharp very well, but every now and\nthen, she surprises me.",
    "charaepi_ch0048_80_gima/2301_1201_3300_10": "That’s why I adore her so much.",
    "charaepi_ch0048_80_gima/2301_0301_3400_10": "You know her well?",
    "charaepi_ch0048_80_gima/2301_0401_3500_10": "Bisharp and I go way back.",
    "charaepi_ch0048_80_gima/2301_0401_3600_10": "That’s why I almost always know what\nshe’s thinking.",
    "charaepi_ch0048_80_gima/2301_0302_3700_10": "You’re best buddies, eh?",
    "charaepi_ch0048_80_gima/2301_0402_3800_10": "That’s right. We’ve been partners for ages.",
    "charaepi_ch0048_80_gima/2301_1201_3900_10": "When we battle, Bisharp often goes into motion\nbefore I’ve even given her a command, because\nshe knows what I’m going to say.",
    "charaepi_ch0048_80_gima/2301_1201_4000_10": "I guess after spending so much time around a\nrisk taker like me, she’s gotten pretty good at\nreading people.",
    "charaepi_ch0048_80_gima/2301_1201_4100_10": "I can’t say for sure if she really understands my\nevery thought.",
    "charaepi_ch0048_80_gima/2301_1201_4200_10": "But I know I’ve always got her back—and she’s\nalways got mine.",
    "charaepi_ch0048_80_gima/2301_1201_4300_10": "Well, would you look at that? She’s itching to put\nher freshly sharpened blades to the test.",
    "charaepi_ch0048_80_gima/2301_1201_4400_10": "What do you say, [Name:PlayerNickname ]?\nCare for a battle?",
    "charaepi_ch0048_80_gima/2301_1201_4500_10": "When it comes to surprises, you definitely are full\nof them.",
