    "ch0115_40_denji/0101_0701_02_10": "Today’s a new beginning. I can’t wait to see how\nwe’re going to spend it together.",
    "ch0115_40_denji/7101_0701_01_10": "Taking on new challenges is one way to make\nlife a thrill.",
    "ch0115_40_denji/7101_0701_02_10": "Together with Electivire, I’m resolving to find new\nways to have fun in battle!",
    "ch0115_40_denji/7102_0701_01_10": "Electivire is a force of nature to be reckoned\nwith. Once I start talking about him, I just\ncan’t stop...",
    "ch0115_40_denji/7102_0701_02_10": "Like, did you know that in terms of electrical\nenergy output, Electivire is one of the best of\nall Electric-type Pokémon?",
    "ch0115_40_denji/7102_0701_03_10": "Thanks to him, I have all the electricity I’ll ever\nneed to tinker around with machines.",
    "ch0115_40_denji/7103_0701_01_10": "When I’m with Electivire, I feel really pumped\nup and ready for anything!",
    "ch0115_40_denji/7103_0701_02_10": "I’m starting to sound like Flint. Watch, now I’ll start\nsaying stuff like, “We’re burning hotter than ever!”\nOr, “We’re on fire!”",
    "ch0115_40_denji/7104_0701_01_10": "I love this outfit. It’s got a certain power to it,\nlike surging lightning.",
    "ch0115_40_denji/7104_0701_02_10": "I’ve been having the most fun I’ve had since...I\ndon’t know when! And it’s all thanks to this outfit.",
    "ch0115_40_denji/7104_0701_03_10": "I thought it might spark lots of inspiration for me\nas well, but that hasn’t happened yet...",
    "ch0115_40_denji/7105_0701_01_10": "Check out my new resolutions for this year:\nelectric battles with [Name:PlayerNickname ]!\nAnd cutting-edge machine modifications!",
    "ch0115_40_denji/7105_0701_02_10": "Hmm. Now that I think about it, I guess that’s\nwhat I always do anyway...",
    "ch0115_40_denji/1701_0701_01_10": "I was just hit by a flash of inspiration—to give\nyou this!",
    "ch0115_40_denji/1701_0701_02_10": "Put it to good use!",
    "ch0115_40_denji/1701_0702_01_10": "If it comes in handy on your journey, that’d be\nreally awesome.",
    "ch0115_40_denji/2501_0701_01_10": "Electivire and Luxray get along great. You’d almost\nthink they were siblings!",
    "ch0115_40_denji/2501_0701_02_10": "When it comes to how they act with me, though,\nit’s like they’re polar opposites.",
    "ch0115_40_denji/2501_0701_03_10": "Luxray is really responsible, making sure to stop\nme if I’m spending too much time tinkering\nwith machines.",
    "ch0115_40_denji/2501_0701_04_10": "Electivire, on the other hand, gets right in there\nwith me and gets lost in the endless tinkering.",
    "ch0115_40_denji/2501_0702_01_10": "The other day, Electivire got way too worked up\nduring a Pokémon battle. Luxray gave him a\ngood scolding.",
    "ch0115_40_denji/2501_0702_02_10": "I felt kinda bad about that...but watching them\ninteract like that can be pretty fun sometimes.",
    "ch0115_40_denji/2511_0701_01_10": "Since this outfit matches Electivire’s look, I feel a\nreal connection with him when I wear it—like we\nshare one heart and one mind.",
    "ch0115_40_denji/2511_0701_02_10": "We’re so connected, in fact, that I feel like\nwe could let loose a surge of electricity at\nany moment!",
    "ch0115_40_denji/2511_0701_03_10": "Why are you looking at me like that? I was\njust joking!",
    "ch0115_40_denji/2511_0702_01_10": "The other day, I was walking through town, and\nI started imagining taking apart all the machines\nthat I saw around me.",
    "ch0115_40_denji/2511_0702_02_10": "It was fun, but maybe I get a little carried away\nwhen I’m excited about something.",
    "ch0115_40_denji/3001_0701_01_10": "Another day, huh? Let’s jump-start it and have\na blast!",
    "ch0115_40_denji/3003_0701_01_10": "I’m resolved to try out some new renovations—\nor rather, battle tactics—that haven’t been\ndone before!",
    "ch0115_40_denji/3005_0701_01_10": "I wonder if the owner of this island would let me\nlight it up at night real bright, just like this outfit\nof mine!",
