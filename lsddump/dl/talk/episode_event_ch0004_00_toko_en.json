    "episode_event_ch0004_00_toko/4007_1001_2000_10": "I...guess so? Maybe?\nWhy don’t we just come back again tomorrow\nand wait in line for a good, not-melted one?",
    "episode_event_ch0004_00_toko/4007_1001_2100_10": "We’ll have plenty of time to chat while we wait.\nMaybe we can get to know each other a\nlittle better!",
    "episode_event_ch0004_00_toko/4007_1001_2200_10": "That’s not a bad idea. Like you said before,\nwaiting in line is part of what makes\nCasteliacones delicious, right?",
