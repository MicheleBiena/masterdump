    "ch0004_00_toko/0101_0701_02_10": "Things just aren’t as exciting\nif you’re not around.\nCome on, let’s do our best today!",
    "ch0004_00_toko/0601_0701_01_10": "I’m well known as a Trainer\nwho’s good in battles!",
    "ch0004_00_toko/0601_0701_02_10": "I’ve gotten good at what I love,\nand what I love is winning battles!",
    "ch0004_00_toko/0601_0701_03_10": "Winning a no-holds-barred battle...\nIt’s the best feeling in the world!",
    "ch0004_00_toko/0601_0702_01_10": "When you battle, don’t you\nget that real strong desire to win?\nEspecially if it’s against a strong opponent!",
    "ch0004_00_toko/0601_0702_02_10": "I bet you like to win, too, don’t you?\nIf so, you might do some amazing things\nin battle someday!",
    "ch0004_00_toko/0602_0701_01_10": "I want to experience for myself\nevery fun thing that there is.",
    "ch0004_00_toko/0602_0701_02_10": "I keep finding new things I want to try out...\nAnd before I know it, my schedule’s\njust bursting at the seams!",
    "ch0004_00_toko/0602_0701_03_10": "*sigh*\nI wish days were much, muuuuuch longer.",
    "ch0004_00_toko/0602_0702_01_10": "My schedule is packed full, but don’t worry!\nI can handle this—no problem.",
    "ch0004_00_toko/0602_0702_02_10": "Don’t you underestimate the potential of\nthe expert Trainer Hilda!",
    "ch0004_00_toko/0603_0701_01_10": "My Tepig is a dear partner to me.\nShe’s kept me company through all my traveling.",
    "ch0004_00_toko/0603_0701_02_10": "I feel like my dream of becoming the best\nTrainer in the world will come true if\nI’m with Tepig.",
    "ch0004_00_toko/0603_0701_03_10": "And you better believe I’m gonna make it real!\nI hope you’re as excited as I am for that day!",
    "ch0004_00_toko/0603_0702_01_10": "You know, when I give Tepig food,\nshe always sears it before eating it.",
    "ch0004_00_toko/0603_0702_02_10": "So I make sure to give her food that won’t get\nruined even if it’s heated up!",
    "ch0004_00_toko/0603_0702_03_10": "I still can’t forget the look Tepig gave me after\nshe tried to cook ice cream and melted it...",
    "ch0004_00_toko/0604_0701_01_10": "I learned through my travels that the world is\nreally huge—and that both Pokémon and people\nall have different ideas and ways of thinking.",
    "ch0004_00_toko/0604_0701_02_10": "So, maybe my travels would have been different\nif I’d traveled with some other Pokémon\ninstead of Tepig.",
    "ch0004_00_toko/0604_0701_03_10": "But I am who I am, and I met you because I’m\nwith Tepig.",
    "ch0004_00_toko/0604_0701_04_10": "That’s what I call a fateful encounter!",
    "ch0004_00_toko/0604_0702_01_10": "I don’t spend a lot of time\nthinking about “What if...”",
    "ch0004_00_toko/0604_0702_02_10": "Because for me, right now is the best there is!",
    "ch0004_00_toko/0604_0702_03_10": "There’s no point in regretting things\nafter they happen. I’d rather\nspend the time enjoying battles!",
    "ch0004_00_toko/0605_0701_01_10": "You know, it’s something that’ll\nhave to wait for another day, but...",
    "ch0004_00_toko/0605_0701_02_10": "There’s one person I really, \nreally want to battle against.",
    "ch0004_00_toko/0605_0701_03_10": "Can’t you guess?\nIt’s you, [Name:PlayerNickname ]!",
    "ch0004_00_toko/0605_0701_04_10": "I think you’ll become an even stronger,\neven more amazing Trainer than you are now.",
    "ch0004_00_toko/0605_0701_05_10": "And once you get there, I want to have \nan all-out battle with you.\nOne Trainer against another.",
    "ch0004_00_toko/0605_0701_06_10": "I want to be someone who’s always strong,\nalways cool... Someone people look up to.\nThat’s my goal.",
    "ch0004_00_toko/0605_0702_01_10": "When the time comes to battle you,\nI’m not going to hold anything back!",
    "ch0004_00_toko/0605_0702_02_10": "It’d be super uncool if I didn’t give\n100 percent when we’re about to decide\nwho’s the most powerful Trainer!",
    "ch0004_00_toko/1701_0701_01_10": "Oh, it’s you!\nMmm, just one minute...",
    "ch0004_00_toko/1701_0701_02_10": "Ah, found it! Here, this is for you!",
    "ch0004_00_toko/1701_0701_03_10": "Didn’t you want something like this?\nEven if not, I’m sure it’ll come in handy.\nKeep it!",
    "ch0004_00_toko/1701_0702_01_10": "If I find anything else,\nI’ll be sure to let you know!",
    "ch0004_00_toko/2501_0701_01_10": "Not to brag or anything, but you know this sync\npair right here is pretty strong in battle, right?",
    "ch0004_00_toko/2501_0701_02_10": "So I always get asked about the secret to\nbecoming stronger.",
    "ch0004_00_toko/2501_0701_03_10": "But to be honest, I don’t really have a good\nanswer to that...",
    "ch0004_00_toko/2501_0701_04_10": "It’s like...hard to explain. Instinct, I guess?\nI focus so much on the battle that I don’t\nreally remember what I do.",
    "ch0004_00_toko/2501_0701_05_10": "I wonder if my Pokémon has\nthe same kind of thing...",
    "ch0004_00_toko/2501_0702_01_10": "The only thing I think about during battle\nis the word “victory”!",
    "ch0004_00_toko/2501_0702_02_10": "I think my Pokémon’s the same, too.\nWe become more in sync every time we battle!",
    "ch0004_00_toko/2501_0702_03_10": "So we’re able to...really, y’know,\nclick and be in the zone.",
    "ch0004_00_toko/2511_0701_01_10": "I’ve been told that our sync pair seems to be full\nof spirit and determination whenever we battle.",
    "ch0004_00_toko/2511_0701_02_10": "I guess it makes sense. I definitely \ndon’t want to lose, so I get in the zone.",
    "ch0004_00_toko/2511_0701_03_10": "Winning is cool!\nThat’s all that matters!",
    "ch0004_00_toko/2511_0701_04_10": "*sigh* I’m joking, of course! \nBut don’t you think that’s \na cool way to look at it?",
    "ch0004_00_toko/2511_0701_05_10": "I mean, we’re definitely getting stronger, so\nwhy not let people see it?",
    "ch0004_00_toko/2511_0702_01_10": "It’s not like I’m trying to intimidate my\nopponents, OK?\nYou don’t have to believe me, but it’s true.",
    "ch0004_00_toko/2511_0702_02_10": "Still, even my partner seems to...radiate\nstrength, I guess?",
    "ch0004_00_toko/2511_0702_03_10": "I feel like she’s grown in confidence since I\nfirst met her.",
    "ch0004_00_toko/2511_0702_04_10": "Heh, it’s definitely reliable!\nI’m really proud of my partner.",
    "ch0004_00_toko/3001_0701_01_10": "Morning! Let’s go get ’em again today!",
    "ch0004_00_toko/3002_0701_01_10": "Morning! I’m looking forward to a\nbunch more Pokémon battles today!",
    "ch0004_00_toko/3003_0701_01_10": "Hi! Afternoon already, huh? What are you up to?",
    "ch0004_00_toko/3004_0701_01_10": "Hi! Now that you’re here,\nlet’s go have some fun!",
    "ch0004_00_toko/3005_0701_01_10": "Hey! Still ready for more, huh?",
    "ch0004_00_toko/3006_0701_01_10": "Hey! Is it that late already? Time sure does fly!",
